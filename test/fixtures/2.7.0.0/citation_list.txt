"2837","S131","Page 482<br>JOHN R. MICKEY, deceased. Among the honored pioneers of Louisa County, who deserve especial mention in this volume, is John R. Mickey. He was born in Pennsylvania in 1812, and went when a small lad to Richland County, Ohio, with his parents, and there received his education in the common schools. In that county he formed the acquaintance of Miss Sarah Wasson, and when he was but nineteen years of age they were united in marriage. She was a native of Richland County, and there one child was born to them, Mary, Oct. 23, 1832, who is now the wife of Robert C. Dryden, a prominent citizen of Louisa County, whose sketch appears elsewhere in this work. She was about six months old when the parents left Ohio and settled in Peoria County, Ill., where they remained for two years. Another child was there born to them, John M., April 20, 1834, and is now a farmer of Henry County, Iowa. About the spring of 1835 the family removed to Des Moines County, Iowa, locating in Pleasant Grove Township, where Mr. Mickey entered a small farm, upon which they resided until 1837. One child graced their union in Des Moines County, Isaac, who was born Oct. 11, 1835. In 1837 Mr. Mickey settled permanently in Louisa County, entering a farm on what is now section 26, Morning Sun Township, though after two years he traded it for 212 acres on the same section, known as the James Gothrop farm.<br><br>Six children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Mickey in Louisa County: Joshua, born March 17, 1838, died May 1, 1876; Robert, born May 31, 1840, is now engaged in farming in Marion County, Kan.; Peter C., born Jan. 20, 1842, died in Oregon, April 11, 1887; Thomas C., born Jan. 22, 1844, is a blacksmith in Shelby, Shelby Co., Iowa; Joseph W., born March 24, 1846, is now engaged in farming in Marion County, Kan. James D., born March 20, 1848, is also a resident farmer of Marion County, Kan.<br><br>On the 3d of October, 1849, John R. Mickey, the pioneer, was called to his final home. He was a man who always identified himself with any enterprise for the advancement of the Community where he resided. He was a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and took great interest in its growth and advancement. He aided largely in its support and was an earnest worker for the cause. The death of Mr. Mickey was felt throughout the county, for his honesty, his kindness to those in need, and his plain, unassuming life had won for him many friends.<br><br>Mrs. Mickey was again united in married, with David T. Blake, and to them were born two children: David C., May 29, 1852, and Hiram D., May 13, 1855. Mr. and Mrs. Blake are now living in Marion County, Kan. He is a member of the Baptist Church, while his wife belongs to the Methodist. While they were residents of Louisa County they received the highest respect of the community."
