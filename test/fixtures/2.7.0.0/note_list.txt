Katharine Cochrane uses the same spelling (BILL) in the chart which she drew.<br>These five documents were tied together along with a note by JCT Cochrane which reads as follows:<br>My fathers will dated Oct7/13 bequeathed to my mother and any child or children of the said S.S.

His father<br>(1592-1631), a man of the most profligate life, who married for his<br>second wife Lady Anne, daughter of Ferdinando Stanley, fifth earl of<br>Derby, and widow of Grey Brydges, fifth baron Chandos, was executed<br>for unnatural offences, after a trial by his peers, on 14 may 1631.<br>He was the only son and heir of George Touchet, baron Audley<br>(1550-1617), sometime governor of Utrecht, who was wounded at the<br>siege of Kinsale on 24 December 1601, was an undertaker in the<br>plantation of Ulster, was summoned by writ to the Irish House of Lords<br>on 11 March 1613-14, was created a peer of Ireland as Baron Audley of<br>Orier, County Armagh, and Earl of Castlehaven, County Cork, on 6<br>September 1616, and died in March 1617.<br>When he was a boy of thirteen or fourteen, James, earl of Castlehaven,<br>was married to Elisabeth Brydges (daughter of his father's second<br>wife, Anne, by her first husband, Grey Brydges, fifth baron Chandos of<br>Sudeley). When she was barely twelve years of age, the girl had been<br>forced by her stepfather into criminal intercourse with her mother's<br>lover, Henry Skipworth. She died in 1679, and was buried on 16 March<br>at St. Martin's-in-the-fields. Utterly neglected as to his education,<br>and discusted at the scenes of bestiality he was compelled to witness,<br>but preserving his natural sense of decency intact, 'he appealed for<br>protection from the earl, his natural father, to the father of his<br>country, the king's majesty,' and was instrumental in bringing his<br>father to justice. His conduct, though a severe strain on his filial<br>duty, was regarded with approval, and on 3 June 1633 he was created<br>Baron Audley of Hely, with remainder 'to his heirs for ever,' and with<br>the place and precedency of George, his grandfather; but in the<br>meanwhile most of his father's estates in England had passed into the<br>possession of Lord Cottington and others. In so far as the creation<br>was virtually a restoration to an ancient dignity, it lay outside the<br>power of the crown alone to make it, but necessary confirmation was<br>obtained by act of parliament in 1678. As for the Irish peerage, it<br>was held to be protected by the statute 'de donis,' preserving all<br>entailed honours against forfeiture for felony.<br>Feeling attracted to a soldier's life, Castlehaven obtained permission<br>to visit the theater of war on the continent, and was at Rome in 1638<br>when, in consequence of the prospect of war between England and<br>Scotland, he was commanded to return home. Setting out immediately,<br>he reached England early in the following year. He attended Charles I<br>at Berwick, but after the first pacification he returned to the<br>continent and witnessed the capitulation of Arras by Owen Roe O'Neill<br>to the French. Returning to England to put his affairs there in<br>order, he afterwards proceeded for the same purpose to Ireland, and<br>was on the point of leaving the latter country when the rebellion<br>broke out on 23 october 1641. Hastening to Dublin, he offered his<br>services to the government; but the Lords justices, Sir William<br>Parsons and Sir John Borlase, suspecting his motives as a Roman<br>catholic, declined his offer, as likewise they did his request to be<br>permitted to repair to England, requiring him, on the contrary, to<br>retire to his house at Maddenstown in County Kildare, and if need were<br>'to make fair weather' with the rebels. Obeying their commands, he at<br>once proceeded thither, and was instrumental in relieving the<br>distressed English in those parts. But his hesitating conduct in not<br>joining the Earl of Ormonde at the battle of Kilrush on 15 April 1642,<br>and his undertaking to mediate between the Lords of the Pale and the<br>government, affording plausible grounds for doubting his loyalty, he<br>was towards the latter end of May indicted of high treason at Dublin.<br>'Amazed at this sad and unexpected news,' he posted to Dublin,<br>presented himself before the council, and after some debate was<br>committed to the custody of one of the sheriffs of the city. Several<br>month passed and, learning that it was intended to remove him into<br>stricter confinement in the castle, he resolved, 'with God's help, not<br>tamely to die butchered,' and, having managed to elude the vigilance<br>of his keeper, he escaped on 27 September into the Wicklow mountains.<br>His intention was 'to gain a passage by Wexford into France, and from<br>thence into England;' but coming to Kilkenny, the headquaters of the<br>confederate catholics, he was persuaded to accept a command in the<br>army, and was appointed general of horse under Sir Thomas Preston<br>(afterwards Viscount Tara). Such is his own account in the 'Memoirs'<br>and 'Remontrance;' but it was believed among the northern Irish that<br>his escape was a contrivance on the part of the Earl of Ormonde 'to<br>work and understanding' between him and his kindred in rebellion,<br>Castlehaven being related to him through the marriage of his sister<br>with Edmund Roe Butler.<br>Castlehaven served with Preston at the capture of Burros Castle on 30<br>December, and of Birr on 19 January following (1643), and, being<br>entrusted with the execution of the articles of capitulation of the<br>latter, he conveyed the garrison safely to Athy. He commanded the<br>horse at the battle of Ross on 18 March, where the confederates were<br>defeated by the Marquis of Ormonde, and when Preston, having rallied<br>his forces ,sat down before Ballynekill, he intercept and routed a<br>strong detachment sent to raise the siege under colonel Crawford near<br>Athy on 13 April. His main business was to cover Kilkenny, but, in<br>consequence of the progress Inchiquin (O'Brien, Murrough, first Earl<br>of Inchiquin) was making in Munster, he was sent with what forces he<br>could collect into that province. On 4 June he overtook Sir C.<br>Vavasour near Castle Lyons, and defeated him with heavy loss, killing<br>some six hundred men on the spot, taking Sir Charles himself and<br>several of his officers prisoners, and capturing all his cannon and<br>baggage, with little or no injury to himself. Returning to Kilkenny,<br>he was afterwards employed in reducing the outstanding fortresses in<br>County Kildare between the Barrow and the Liffey, when his further<br>progress was stopped by the conclusion of the cessation, in promoting<br>wich he had taken an active part, on 15 September. He was very useful<br>in providing shipping at Wexford to transport the Irish soldiers<br>furnished by Ormonde for the king's service into England, and, the<br>Scottish forces under major-general Robert Monro in Ulster refusing to<br>be bound by the cessation, he was appointed to the command of six<br>thousand foot and six hundred horse to be sent to the aid of Owen Roe<br>O'Neill in the following year (1644). But before he could proceed<br>thither he was ordered to suppress a local insurrection in County<br>Mayo. This done, he effected a junction with O'Neill at Portlester,<br>and toward the end of July Both armies marches towards Tanderagee.<br>But Monro avoided giving battle, and Castlehaven, after lying<br>intrenched near Charlemont for two months, and exhausting his<br>provisions, retired, 'taking a great round' to Ballyhaise in County<br>Cavan, much to the dissatisfaction of the northern Irish, who charged<br>him with cowardice. Havin seen his army into winter quarters, and<br>coming to Kilkenny, he found the Supreme Council in a state of<br>consternation owing to the defection of Lord Inchiquin and the<br>surrender of Duncannon Fort by sir Laurence Esmonde. He served as a<br>volunteer under Preston at the siege of Duncannon, and was present at<br>its rendition on 18 March 1645. But the truce with Inchiquin drawing<br>near its expiration, he was sent with five thousand foot and one<br>thousand horse into Munster, and speedily reduced all the castles in<br>the baronies of Imokilly and Barrimore, and, having wasted the country<br>up to the walls of Cork, he sat down before Youghal, 'thinking to<br>distress the place' into a surrender; but the town being relieved he<br>marched off, and, having 'triffled out the remains of the campain in<br>destroying the harvest,' put his army into winter quarters and<br>returned to Kilkenny towards the latter end of November. He was one<br>of the signatories to the contract with the Papal Nuncio, Giovanni<br>Battista Rinuccini, on 19 February 1646, not to conclude a peace till<br>provision had been made for the full exercise of the catholic<br>religion; but, after the publication of the peace between the<br>confederates and Ormonde on 30 July, he was deputed by the latter to<br>proceed to Waterford for the purpose of persuading the Papal Nuncio's<br>acceptance of it. Failing in this, he threw himself unreservedly on<br>Ormonde's side, and when the latter, in consequence of O'Neill's<br>determination to support the Nuncio with his army, was compelled to<br>fall back on Dublin, he accompanied him thither, bearing the sword of<br>state before him on his entrance into the city on 13 September.<br>Afterwards, when the question arose whether terms should be made with<br>the parliament or with the supreme council, he gave his opinion in<br>favour of the former - 'for giving up to parliament, when the King<br>should have England, he would have Ireland with it; but to the Nuncio<br>and his party it might prove far other ways, and the two kingdoms<br>remain separate.'<br>He quit Ireland apparently before the parliamentary commissioners<br>arrived, and, repairing to France, was present at the battle of<br>Landrecies, fighting in Prince Rupert's troop, commanded by Captain<br>Somerset Fox. Afterwards going to St. Germain, he remained there in<br>attendance on the Queen and Prince of Wales till latter end of<br>September 1648, when he returned with the Marquis of Ormonde to<br>Ireland. A peace having been concluded with the confederates in<br>January 1659, he was appointed general of th horse, and, with five<br>thousand foot and one thousand horse, employed in reducing the<br>fortresses holding out for O'Neill in Queen's county. But his<br>half-starved soldiers deserted in shoals, and after the capture of<br>Athy on 21 May he complained that the fifteen hundred foot that<br>remainded with him were only kept alive by stealing cows. Worn out<br>with fatigue and dissatisfied at the preference shown by some of the<br>general assembly for Lord Taaffe, his competitor for the generalship<br>of the horse, he obtained permission to retire to Kilkenny, where he<br>was instrumental in suppressing a revolt of friars. But the<br>difficulties connected with his command being shortly afterwards<br>removed, he joined the army under Ormonde at Rathmines, and shared his<br>defeat by Jones on 2 August. He signed the order for the defence of<br>Drogheda, and, having been entrusted by Ormonde with a special command<br>over the forces destined for the relief of the southern towns, he<br>succeeded on 6 October in throwing fifteen hundred men into Wexford,<br>thereby enabling Synnot to break of his correspondance with Cromwell.<br>A few day later he forced Ireton to raise the siege of Duncannon; but<br>being appointed governor of waterford, with one thousand men to<br>reinforce the garrison, he was refused admittance by the citizens, and<br>'after several days' dispute marched away.' During the winter he<br>amused himself in his favorite pastime, fox-hunting. He was appointed<br>commander-in-chief of the Leinster forces by Ormonde, whom the<br>exigencies of the situation drove to Limerick early in the following<br>year for the purpose of raising reinforcements 'to attend Cromwell's<br>motions,' and in March 1650 Castlehaven took the field with some four<br>thousand men. Finding himself too weak to assume the offensive, he<br>contended himself with watching Hewson's movements, and indeed managed<br>the wrest Athy out his hands. But after the surrender of Kilkenny to<br>Cromwell on 28 March 1650, he withdrew to the borders of King's<br>County, and in June made an unsuccessful attempt to relieve Tecroghan,<br>which 'was by the confession of all parties, even of the enemy,<br>allowed to be the gallantest action that had been performed since the<br>beginning of the war.'<br>Afterwards finding it impossible to keep an army together, he granted<br>commission for horse and foot to all that applied for them, whereby,<br>although managing to keep up an appearance of war, he gave to it the<br>character of a freebooting campaign, wich caused as much arm to his<br>own party as to the enemy. Meanwhile, the Lord-Lieutenant, having<br>been foiled in his efforts to recruit his army through the obstinacy<br>of the citizens of Limerick refusing to receive a garrison, and seeing<br>no hope of effecting a compromise with the extreme Irish, had come to<br>the determination to quit the kingdom. Castlehaven did his utmost to<br>combat his resolution, urging him to 'make friendship with the bishops<br>and the nation.' But his overtures were treated with disdain; 'the<br>bishop and the nation' were bent on managing theirs affairs in their<br>own way, and so, having appointed Clanricarde his Lord-deputy and<br>Castlehaven commander-in-chief in the province of Munster and county<br>of Clare, Ormonde sailed from Galway Bay for France in December. The<br>approach of Ireton however, causing the citizens of Limerick somewhat<br>to relax their opposition, they admitted Castlehaven himself 'with the<br>matter of one troup of horse.' The concession enabled him to<br>transport two thousand men into Kerry and clear that county almost<br>entirely of the enemy. Returning for Christmas to Portumna, he early<br>in following year (1651) crossed the shannon into County Tipperary;<br>but the object of the expedition was frustrated by the plundering<br>propensities of his officers, and, being compelled to retreat before<br>Ireton and Broghill, he recrossed the Shannon at Athlone. Failing to<br>prevent Ireton sitting down before Limerick,the capitulation of that<br>city on 27 October, followed by the loss of County Clare, forced him<br>and Clanricarde into Iar Connaught. But, the situation growing daily<br>more desesperate, he was on 10 April despatched by Clanricarde to<br>France for the purpose of soliciting aid to enable the latter to<br>maintain 'a mountain war.'<br>Reaching Brest after a sharp encounter with an English vessel in the<br>Channel, he posted to Saint Germain, but, failing to obtain the<br>supplies required, he was granted permission to enter the service of<br>the Prince of Condé in the war of the Fronde. Being appointed to the<br>command of a regiment of horse, he was present at the fight in the<br>Faubourg-St- Antoine on 2 July, and, quitting Paris with Condé, he was<br>taken prisoner by Turenne at Comercy. Owing to the intervention of<br>the Duke of York he was shortly afterwards exchanged, and being placed<br>at the head of the Irish regiment in the Spanish service with the rank<br>of Maréchal-de-camp or major-general, he was present at the siege of<br>Rocroy (1653), of Arras (1654), the relief of Valenciennes and the<br>capture of Condé (1656), the siege of St Guislain and the relief of<br>Cambrai (1657), and the battle of the Dunes on 14 June 1658. The<br>peace of the Pyrenees putting an end to the war in the following year<br>(7 November 1659), and Charles II being shortly afterwards restored,<br>he returned to England. But the confiscation of his property by the<br>Commonwealth rendering it impossible to support his dignity, he<br>obtained a grant in September 1660 of all wastes and encroached lands<br>to be discovered by him in the counties of Surrey, Berks, Stafford,<br>Devon, and Cornwall, and either then or subsequently received a<br>pension out of the Irish establishment. On the outbreak of the War<br>with Holland (1665-1667) he served as a volunteer in several naval<br>actions, and in June 1667 landed at Ostend with 2,400 recruits for the<br>old English Regiment, of which he was appointed colonel. His men were<br>used to strengthen the garrison at Nieuport, Lille, Courtrai,<br>Oudenarde, and other places; but, the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle (2 mai<br>1668) putting 'an end to our trouble, for it cannot be called a war,'<br>he shortly afterwards returned to England. Peace being concluded<br>between with Holland and England in 1674, he again repaired abroad,<br>and was present at the battle of Senef on 11 August. He commanded the<br>Spanish foot in 1676, and served in the trenches at Maastricht, 'by<br>much to bloodiest siege that I ever saw.' The following year he was<br>at the siege of Charleroi, and on 14 August 1678 at the battle before<br>Mons; but returning to England after the peace of Nimeguen, he<br>published in 1680 his 'memoirs,' 'from the year 1642 to the year<br>1651.'<br>The book, a small octavo volume with a dedication to Charles II, is,<br>on the whole, what it claims to be, a trustworthy account of the War<br>in Ireland from a Catholic-Royalist standpoint. But, being written<br>from memory, it is not wholly free from accidental inaccuracies, while<br>the very biased view taken of the conduct of the lords justicies<br>Parsons and Borlase at the beginning of the rebellion, and of the<br>peace of 1643, renders a circumspect use of it necessary. Appearing<br>as it did during the heat of the 'popish plot,' 'a very unseasonable<br>time,' remarks Carte, 'for reviving or canvasing such a subject,' it<br>was attacked by Arthur Annesley, earl of Anglesey, at that time lord<br>privy seal, in 'A letter from a person of honour in the country,'<br>London, 1681. At Charles II's request, Ormonde replied to Annesley in<br>'A letter ...in answer to the...Earl of Anglesey...his observations<br>and reflections upon the Earl of Castlehaven's Memoirs,' 12 November<br>1681. Anglesey retorted in another 'Letter,' 7 December 1681, where<br>upon Ormonde appealed to the Pprivy Council on 17 June 1682 to appoint<br>a committee to examine Anglesey's 'letter.' The matter ended, as it<br>was probably intended it should do, in the dissimal of Anglesey and<br>the transfer of the privy seal to Lord Halifax. The charges prefered<br>by Anglesey were repeated in 'Brief reflections on the Earl of<br>Castlehaven's memoirs,' by Edmund Borlase, London, 1682. In the<br>spring of 1683 it was rumoured that Castlehaven, Lansdowne, and other<br>noblemen intended 'to go as volunteers to the holy war in Hungary'.<br>But he seems to have occupied himself preparing a fresh edition of his<br>'memoirs,' published in 1685, bringing the narrative down to the peace<br>of Nimeguen. An edition with an anonymous preface by Charles<br>O'Conor, was published at Waterford in 1753, and another at Dublin in<br>1815.<br>Castlehaven died at Kilcash, County Tipperary, his sister Butler's<br>house, on 11 October 1684, and was succeeded by his youngest brother<br>Mervyn (the second son, George, a Benedictine monk, being expressly<br>passed over in the act of 1678). Of his three sisters, Frances became<br>the wife of Richard Butler of Kilcash, brother of the Duke Ormonde;<br>Dorothy, the wife of Edmund Butler, son and heir of Lord Mountgarret;<br>and Lucy, the wife of Gerald Fitzmaurice, son of Lord Kerry."

The only way they could get to school was to cross a river in a small row boat.  George didn't like the other boys much and was a bit of a bully when his father and step-mother was out of sight. Nearly every day on the way to school, when they were half way across the river, George would tip them out of the boat and laugh like mad.  Every day the boys would go to school like little drowned rats.<br>In 1930 George (my Grandfather), married Cinderella Delaney nee Bennett.  My father Jack, never liked her and used to call her Old Black Tot.  Dad always said if he ever saw her he would run over with the car. (I really don't think he would have).  Cinderella used to foster kids and one day in the middle of winter my father came home from work to find 3 or 4 of the foster kids outside without jumpers or shoes.  The poor kids were freezing and this made my dad very angry.  He asked them why they weren't in by the fire keeping warm and one kid aged about 6 said Mrs. Cameron won't let us in.  Dad was fuming and took the kids inside and blew the proverbial out of her.  After that, he disliked her even more. Apparently she also drove George up the wall, but being a devoted husband, he put up with it.  Cinderella was nothing like her namesake, but was a real nag, etc.  George had a massive heart attack and died in hospital and my dad blamed her and said it was her fault that he'd had a heart attack.  This was when he tried to strangle her.<br>My father didn't get too much from his father's will, it all went to his brothers as George owned race horses and dad being a farmer had no interest in them.

He was ordained curate of Keignton Manderville church in 1776  and of Charlton Adam church in 1777.  He presided in both churches as well as the one in High Ham (1803) concurrently until his death in 1809. He married Mary Barrett of High Ham in 1781. When Edmund died in 1809 he left the whole of his effects to his wife, Mary, for the purposes of raising and educating their children, except for £ 2000 which he left to his sister, Lucy. Mary Barrett and her son, William Southby, then parceled up the land and sold it. It is not known if the family had the use of the vicarage, 'The Abbey', in Charlton Adam or had to leave when he died. They sold the last of the land in 1819 when the eldest sister Lucy Anne married the Reverend William Sharpe of Charlton Mackrell.

On their return to Canada they were accompanied by his mother and sister, Mary Sophia, whose intention was to look after William Southby and his daughter Lucy, while his wife Mary had their second child, after which they would return to live with Mr. and Mrs. Sharpe in Charlynch. Unfortunately Mary Southby miscarried.<br>---<br>In 1828 Richard and his wife Frances (Fanny) moved into their newly built house 'Levellands'. Besides being farmers Richard and brother William Southby served on juries, were members of the local militia, and formed an agricultural association. They were friends with many prominent citizens including Lt. Governor Colbourne and his wife and Mr. Thorne of Thornhill.<br>The Gappers were politically and personally opposed to William Lyon Mackenzie, Samuel Lount and the Reform movement. There was a famous occasion when Richard and his brother-in-law, Edward O'Brien, physically ejected William Lyon Mackenzie from a meeting of the Agricultural Assembly. William Lyon Mackenzie accused them, falsely, of striking him. He mistakenly served William Southby, who was not present at the meeting with a writ instead of Richard.<br>There are many descriptions of the activities of the Gapper family in Canada in the Journals of Mary O'Brien. Richard returned to England around 1852. In 1853 he sold his Canadian house to William Duncan from whose family name Duncan road takes its name.

"NI1737","Rory Maguire was part of the old Gaelic aristocracy of Fermanagh and although apparently part of the new Plantation order of things, he hankered for a return to the rule of the Maguires in Fermanagh. To achieve this it was obviously necessary to eliminate the new Plantation gentry and Rory decided to complete this in one fell swoop.  He planned either to capture or massacre the leading Fermanagh Planter families at a banquet to be held in Castle Hasset (Crevenish Castle).<br>He laid his plans carefully and on the appointed evening his unsuspecting guests arrived. On their way in a groom gave an unmistakable signal to their leader Sir William Cole, the Governor of Enniskillen that something was amiss.  He told him he would have their horses ready for them in ten minutes and should not be parted from their swords in the meantime.  Sir William had already been told to be on his guard by Brian Maguire of Tempo who had made his mind up to side with the new regime in Fermanagh. Their suspicions by now fully aroused Cole and the others determined not to stay and staying together made their way quickly to the safety of Enniskillen. T hey had had a lucky escape.<br>This massacre was intended as a preliminary to the full outbreak of the 1641 Rebellion in Fermanagh and despite its failure Rory and his men went ahead with the uprising. They set upon the local Plantation settlements and began years of destruction and death with the burning of the village of Lisnarick.  Some of the attacks on Fermanagh Planters are chronicled in the 1641 Depositions made soon after and preserved in the library of Trinity College Dublin.<br>Rory Maguire was the brother of Lord Maguire who had been captured attempting to seize Dublin Castle on October 23rd, 1641. He was later executed at Tyburn in London. Rory led the rebellion in Fermanagh and was one of the most prominent individuals in the campaign until his death in 1648. Before the rebellion began he enlisted the support of the O'Flanagans and O'Husseys of Magheraboy among many others of the old Gaelic families throughout Fermanagh.<br>After the burning of Lisnarick, Rory captured Neckarney (Irvinestown) and his brother-in-law, Richard Nugent along with the Mc Caffreys took Archdalestown. The Leitrim Mc Laughlins and Mc Murrays seized Garrison. This village had been the site of the first barrack in Fermanagh which had been erected by Sir John Dunbar. Before it became a garrison and later adopted the name Garrison this pleasant spot on the shores of Lough Melvin was known as Killawhoe according to a note in the Montgomery Mss. This is disputed by Pat Mc Guinness the author of a recent history of Garrison who believes that Killawhoe is actually nearby Kilcoo in County Leitrim.<br>In the end Rory Maguire was killed leading an attack at Jamestown, near Carrick-on-Shannon on November 13th, 1648. Another chapter had closed in the story of what has now become known as Crevenish Castle rather than Castle Hasset."

Accordingly, on July 5th 1670 O'Hossa brought the outlaws' heads, all dripping with gore, into the Court Hose at Enniskillen, where several Justices, including William Archdale, were assembled in open court.  The two heads were set up, as a gruesome warning, in the town of Enniskillen (see Mr. Prendergast's paper on 'The Tory War of Ulster', in the Quarterly Journal of Kilkenny Architechtural Society. 1867).<br>He fled the country in 1688 with his family; old Castle Archdale was finally destroyed in his absence.

"NI1774","Nicholas Montgomery took the name and arms of Archdall in 1728, in place of his own patronymic.  (It is not meant to suggest that there was a sudden change of spelling from Archdale to Archdall in 1728, but simply that the latter spelling was generally accepted about that time.

He met these troubles undaunted and has triumphed over them to a gratifying degree. For the first three years of his residence in the state the grasshoppers ate most of his crops, for several years he was the victim of severe drouth, and he also suffered much from the destruction of crops by hail storms.<br>Mr. Lewin was born in Louisa county, Iowa, December 4, 1848, eldest of the seven children of John A. and Lucretia (Blake) Lewin. The father was of English parentage and born in the Shenandoah valley, Virginia. He served in the Civil war as a member of Company G, Third Iowa Infantry, and died in Andersonville prison.

Mr. Lewin had hunted and trapped over part of the state and was very favorably impressed with the prospects for obtaining good land in Custer county, deciding to locate there. He secured a homestead of one hundred and sixty acres of land and a timber claim of the same size adjoining, on section twenty-four, township nineteen, range seventeen, in Woods Park, which was the home place for a number of years. He did much to help in the early upbuilding and development of the region and became successful in his personal enterprises. He helped organize school district number six, serving as the first director of the school board. In 1892 he sold out and purchased two hundred acres of land on section nineteen, range seventeen, which is now the home place, being well improved and equipped for raising grain and fruit.

"NI2056","From Ellen Lewin:<br>John Almer LEWIN b. 7 August 1791 (Shenandoah County, VA) migrated to Pickaway County, OH with William Renick. John married Salome CLUTTER (b. 17 July 1791 Loudoun Co., VA). Salome's family were also with Mr. Renick, as were a number of other families. John and Salome's was the first marriage in Harrison Township, on 24 May 1810 by Squire James Denny.

IA using a bounty land warrant for his service in the war of 1812<br>---<br>From History of Warren County, IA F596<br>John Almer Lewin, an early Pioneer in Iowa, was born Aug 7, 1791 at Gooney Manor, near Front Royal, Sheandoah County VA. He was the sixth of eleven children of Samuel Lewin and Mabel Timartha Hunt. He is described as being six feet tall with black hair, blue eyes and fair complexion.<br>While yet a young man, John went west to Pickaway Co. OH with a party of settlers led by William Renick. In 1810, he was married to Salome Clutter of Loudoun County VA who also was a member of that group of settlers from Virginia. Their marriage was the first in Harrison Township of Pickaway County.<br>There were twelve children born to John and Salome: Samuel, Mabel Timartha, Charles C., Washington, Nancy M., Mary, John A. Jr., Silas W., Martha Jane, Joseph, Aaron F. and Oliver P.<br>During the war of 1812, John served in the 1st Regiment of Ohio Militia under Captain Pinney. His unit was captured by the British and he was still a prisoner fro some time after his year of enlistment had expired.<br>The first four children of the family were born in Ohio. It is not known if they lived in areas other than Pickaway Co. The are listed in the 1820 Census in Vigo County Indiana. A History of Vermillion Co., IN states that J. A. Lewin settled in Mound Prairie, Oakwood Township in the spring of 1822. An obituary for daughter Maria Jane says that she was born there in September 1828. According to cenus records she was the last of the five children born in Indiana.<br>Joseph and Aaron F. were born in Illinois, likely Vermillion Co. as this is where the marriages of Mabel and Samuel occurred in 1829 and 1830 respectively. It is likely the family was living in that area until they moved to Iowa in late 1833 or early 1834. While it is not recorded, it seems reasonable to assume that they would have traveled by boat down the Wabash and Ohio Rivers, the up the Mississippi to the vicinity of the future sight of Burlington, IA. It was necessary for them to camp on the Illinois side of the river for a time before they were allowed to cross over to settle the land newly acquired from the Indians. This took place in the spring of 1834. It may be that a few of the settlers were on the site of Burlington before that time, however.<br>John A. Lewin is reported to have made the shingles for the roof of the first store building in the town of Burlington.  Des Moines County, Iowa where Burlington is situated, was organized in 1834 from Wisconsin Territory. Later, in 1836, it was divided and parts of it became Lee, Van Buren, Louisa, Muscatine, and Johnson Counties. A history of Louisa County lists John A. Lewin among the first settlers in that County in Morning Sun township in 1836. The first Territorial Census taken that year lists John and his son-in-law, Riley Driskell (see separate story), in Louisa County. The First Federal Census taken in 1840 shows John, Riley as well as the Lewin sons, Samuel, Charles C. and Washington all established in the area with their own families. It was at this time that the twelfth child of John and Salome, Oliver P. was born.<br>In 1852, and  1856, as a consequence of his service in the War of 1812, John was awarded land grants of eighty acres each, in Sections 25 and 26 in Richland Township, Warren County IA, southeast of the town of Hartford.<br>Salome died in January 1854 at the age of 62 years, 6 months. She is buried in Hartford Cemetery. In 1855, John married Mary Woddell, a widow with three children.<br>Three of Lewin's sons, John A., Jr., Silas W., and Oliver P., lost their lives in the Civil war, leaving numerous family members to mourn their loss.<br>John is listed as living in the home of his son Charles in Sandyville, Warren Co, according to the 1870 Census. It was there that he departed this life on Jan. 14, 1871, and was buried beside his wife, Salome, in Hartford Cemetery.<br>F598<br>John Almer Lewin, Sr., was born Aug. 7, 1791 in Shenandoah County VA, the son of Samuel and Mabel Timartha (Hunt) Lewin. Samuel Lewin was born about 1749 and died in August of 1833 in Shenandoah Co. Va. Research by someone unknown to me and passed on to me by a mutual descendant gives the following information on the Samuel Lewin family. Samuel married Mabel Hunt who was born in Loudoun Co. VA. She died Feb. 23, 1844 in Warren Co. VA. Both  Samuel and Mabel are buried in Lewin Cemetery, Glen Echo, Va.<br>Eleven children were born to this union: 1) William b. March 18, 1784, d.

All marriages were recorded in Shenandoah County except John Almer and Percilla. Percilla was married in Warren Co., IA.<br>John Almer was married to Salome Clutter on May 24, 1810 in Pickaway Co. OH. It was printed in a county history that his marriage was the first to be recorded in that county. John was a private with the Ohio volunteers in the War of 1812. A brief  mention in the history of Vermillion Co. IN says that John Lewin and family were one of the first settlers to build a house or sorts in Oakwood Township in the spring of 1822. Another brief mention in a write up in Burlington IA history says that John Lewin helped build the first general store in Burlington. These three brief mentions in history books lead me to believe that John and Salome Lewin were true pioneers.<br>John and Salome had fourteen children as follows: 1) Samuel b. Jan. 20, 1811 in OH, m.

On the 8th, at 4 o'clock p.m., Majors Terrence and Hubbard, with 450 men, attacked Poindexter, with from 1,000 to 1,300 men, on Silver Creek. The enemy were totally routed, with heavy loss. Seven left dead on the field; many carried off. From 50 to 75 wounded. Our loss reported at 4 killed. The rebel camp was destroyed, and a large number of horses and arms taken. A heavy fog alone saved them from complete destruction. The number of prisoners is reported at 30. JOHN M. PALMER, Brigadier-General.<br>  2] Report of Col. Thomas J. Turner, Fifteenth Illinois Infantry HEADQUARTERS LA MINE CANTONMENT, Otterville, Mo., January 14, 1862. CAPTAIN: Major Hubbard, of the First Missouri Cavalry, returned to this place last night. He left his command on the north side of the river, opposite Booneville. Ice in the river prevented his crossing. He reports that on the 8th instant, at Silver Creek, in Howard County, he attacked the rebels, 900 strong, under command of Colonel Poindexter. After a brisk engagement, which lasted forty minutes, he completely routed the enemy. The enemy's loss was 40 killed and 60 wounded. His loss 6 killed and 19 wounded. He captured 160 horses, 60 wagons, 105 tents, 80 kegs powder, about 200 rifles and shot-guns, and a large quantity of clothing, blankets, and bed-quilts. He has in his possession 160 captured horses and 28 prisoners. The wagons, powder, and other property captured he was compelled to destroy for want of help to remove them. I directed him to bring the prisoners and horses here, unless he received orders to take them to some other point. Major Hubbard is greatly in need of ammunition, as is also all the cavalry at this post. I have been informed that requisitions have been forwarded to Saint Louis for a supply, but they have not been attended to. I would respectfully suggest that an ordnance officer be appointed for the post. I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant, THOS. J. TURNER, Colonel, Commanding Cantonment. Capt. J. C. KELTON, Assistant Adjutant-General.<br>3] Report of Major Torrence, 1st Iowa Cavalry CAMP NEAR FAYETTE, MO., January 10, 1862. GENERAL: I have the honor to report that in compliance with your order I marched my command to Booneville, and was there joined by three companies of Merrill's Horse, under Major Hunt, and at the earliest day possible crossed the Missouri River, and reached camp near Fayette on the evening of the 5th instant, when I was there joined by four companies of the First Missouri, under command of Major Hubbard, and one company of the Fourth Ohio, Captain Foster. We proceeded at once to gather information of the enemy's movements by sending scouts through different portions of this and adjoining counties. On the 7th instant reconnaissances in force were made to Glasgow, Roanoke, and surrounding country, and information received that one Colonel Poindexter was recruiting in this and other counties, and that he had his principal camp somewhere on the headwaters of Silver Creek, with a force of regularly enlisted men from 600 to 800 strong, together with an equal number of aiders and abettors of rebellion. Early upon the morning of the 8th instant we moved out of camp with 500 mounted men in search of their camp, and marched to Roanoke, 15 miles distant, and then in the direction of Silver Creek. When within 4 miles of where the camp was reported to be the column was halted, and the following disposition made of our forces: To Major Hunt was assigned the command of that portion of his forces armed with carbines, and with Major Hubbard's command and Captain Foster's company to  form the advance of the column, to attack the camp, draw their fire, and reply with carbines, when the First Iowa and a portion of Merrill's Horse were to charge upon the camp, mounted, if possible, and if not practicable charge with revolver and saber on foot. To Lieutenant Dustin, of Company F, First Iowa, was assigned the advance guard, supported by Lieutenant Burrows, First Missouri. All being in readiness the column moved forward rapidly, the advance guard driving the enemy's pickets and rushing to the entrance of the camp. The column followed soon after, dismounted, and drew the enemy's fire. They were in a strong position, being protected by ravines, thick underbrush, and timber. Their volley was promptly answered by our forces pouring in a galling fire. Three companies of the First Iowa and a part of a company of Merrill's Horse were then ordered forward to charge the camp, which was promptly done. The enemy were now thrown into confusion and soon began to retreat, leaving horses, guns, together with camp and garrison equipage. It was a complete rout, as the appearance of the camp fully attested. Two companies from the rear were ordered to cut off their retreat, but the darkness and heavy fog, together with the thick underbrush, rendered it<br> impossible. To avoid surprise and to be able to move all our forces forward an order was given to destroy the camp and look up dead and wounded. This was soon accomplished, and the darkness forbidding further pursuit, the whole command was then moved to camp, 23 miles distant. The prompt action of the troops throughout is worthy of the highest praise. Lieutenant Dustin is worthy of honorable mention for his gallant conduct in leading the advance guard; also Major Hunt, of Merrill's Horse; Captains Clinton and Mondell, of the First Missouri, for their gallant and cool bearing during the entire action. The loss of the enemy cannot be actually ascertained, but from the most reliable information their loss in killed and wounded cannot be less than 80 to 100. Yours, most obediently, W. M. G. TORRENCE, Major, First Battalion, First Iowa Cavalry. Brigadier-General Pope., Otterille, Mo.<br>  4] Report of Col. Lewis Merrill, Second Missouri Cavalry HEADQUARTERS MERRILL'S HORSE: Columbia, Mo., January 10, 1862. CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that on the night of Sunday, the 5th, nearly at daylight, I received a dispatch from Colonel Birge (at Sturgeon), stating that a party of some 300 or 400 rebels had camped that night at Renick, and were to move next morning to Roanoke, some 12 or 15 miles from there, with the object of crossing the river at Arrow Rock or Brunswick, and stating that he would attempt to overtake them by daylight of the 6th, and requesting me to co-operate. Not approving the plan proposed for me by Colonel Birge, I sent Lieutenant-Colonel Shaffer, with all the men I could spare, to go by way of Fayette and thence north towards Roanoke and cut off the retreat of the enemy, should Colonel Birge's command not succeed in overtaking him at Renick. Colonel Birge, I understand, went to Renick, and not finding the enemy, returned to Sturgeon the same day. Lieutenant-Colo-nel Shaffer reached Fayette late the night of the 6th, and there found a large cavalry force, consisting of detachments from the First Missouri Cavalry, under command of Major Hubbard, First Iowa Cavalry, under Major Torrence, and Merrill's Horse, under Major Hunt. He then learned during the night that the enemy, variously estimated at from 1,300 to 2,500, were encamped on Smith s farm, about o miles from Roanoke. At the same time he received information that the remains of the command of Colonel Dorsey, which had been engaged in the Mount Zion fight, was then marching to attack me at Columbia. I had only part of one company left when Colonel Shaffer left me, and he knew that part of that would be sent to Jefferson City<br>  to escort the provision train. Early next morning he sent the command of Major Hubbard, which he had found at Fayette, re-enforced by one company of his own   command, to find the enemy's camp, and returned at once to Columbia with the rest of his command. Major Hubbard found the enemy's camp about 14 miles northwest of Fayette about 3 o'clock p.m., and immediately attacked them, routing them completely and taking possession of their camp, which he entirely destroyed. I have no official reports of the engagement from the part of my regiment engaged, and I presume before this Major Hubbard's reports have been received. The loss of my regiment was 2 killed and 3 wounded. The enemy's loss is not positively reported, but 5 are known to have been killed and 14 taken prisoners. This is only what is certainly known. Capt. J. B. Watson, of the rebel army (and believed to have been concerned in the Magi burning), now on recruiting service near here, was captured, with two of his men, to-day by a part of my command. I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, LEWIS MERRILL, Colonel, Commanding Merrill's Horse. Capt. J. C. KELTON, Assistant Adjutant-General."

I am sure that I will never forget pretty loks if it be ever so long before I see her again.

I was very sorry that I did not get to see him for my own part and more so on account of you. Missy I would have written to you sooner but wanted to see Gillam before I wrote.

One day, while crossing, his boat was struck by a cyclone that carried a waterspout, sinking the frail craft, and the passengers all went down with her, except Conaway and one other man, who rose and commenced to swim. They secured an oar to ride on, but Conaway gave it to the other man, and told him to save his life, as he had a family to support. This happened about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and they swam until 3 o'clock the next morning, when they heard a fiddle playing on a passing ship. Having shouted for help, there was a yawl with two men in her sent to their assistance, but these men told them they could not take them in, whereupon Conaway grabbed the craft, told them to take in the other man or he would sink them. They did so, leaving him, but a long rope hung from the ship, which he got hold of, and the swift motion of the ship made him skip upon the water until he was taken in.

His father's ancestors were from Maine and his mother's from South Carolina. <br>Our subject came to Iowa, with his parents, in 1845, the family settling in Louisa County, where they remained for two years, and then removed to Burlington. William E. Blake received his primary education in the common schools, and in 1864 entered Monmouth College, at Monmouth, Ill., graduating from the literary department in 1867. He then took a law course at the University of Iowa, and, graduated in June, 1869. In the following August he began practicing at Burlington, and still occupies the office where he first hung out his shingle. He formed a law partnership, Jan. 1, 1870, with judge T. W. Newman, which has continued to this date, with the exception of four years, during which time the Judge was on the bench. Mr. Blake is a Republican in politics, and a member of the Presbyterian Church.

He is a member of the popular firm of Blake & Blake.<br>For his birth-place we turn to the Buck­eye State, and there, in the town of Morning Sun, June 27, 1844, he was born, his parents being Henry Clay Blake and Mary A., nee Wil­son, both natives of Ohio. He is the eldest of their family of five children, the others being as follows: Wilson .V., of the City of Mexico, editor of the Two Republics; and Mel­ville E., of the firm of Blake & Blake. The other two died in infancy. Henry Clay Blake, the father, was a farmer and merchant. He came to Iowa in the year 1845 and settled in Louisa county, where he was engaged in both merchandising and farming. During the late war he served three years as a member of Company C, First Iowa Cavalry, and his father was at the same time a member of Company B, Thirty-seventh Iowa Infantry. The latter was a veteran of the war of 1812. At the close of the Rebellion Henry C. Blake returned to his home in Iowa, Morning Sun, which he had named after his old Ohio home, and here he spent the residue of his life, dying in 1876, at the age of fifty-seven years. His widow still maintains her residence at that place. She is a member of the United Presbyterian Church, with which he also was identified. For years he figured as one of the leading citizens of his community. He served as a member of the hoard of Supervisors of the county, was a public-spirited and useful man, and for his many excellent traits of character was es­teemed by all who - knew him. Having thus referred to .the parents of Mr. Blake, we now turn for some history of his grandparents. <br>The Blakes originally came to this country from England, and Nehemiah Blake, the grandfather of our subject, was a New Eng­lander, Maine his native State. He was a man of fine physique, and, as already stated, served in both the war of I812 and the Civil war. He had a large family and lived to a good old age, being ninety at the time of his death, which occurred at the home of his son, Henry C., and ten days before his son's death. Dan­iel Wilson, the maternal grandfather of Will­iam E. Blake, was a native of South Carolina, and was a farmer. He was drowned in Ohio in 1844, while in the prime of life. <br>At the time of his father's removal to Iowa, William E. Blake was a little over a year old, and here he has since lived, having passed half a century in the Hawkeye State. He grew up in Louisa county. At Monmouth College, Monmouth, Illinois, he spent some time as a student, and then, having selected the law for his profession, entered the law department of the State University of Iowa, at Iowa City, where, in due time, he completed his course, and in June, 1869, was admitted to the bar. Since August of that year he has been engaged in the practice of his profession at Burlington, where he has won distinction. Also he has been interested in banking. He is a director in both the Merchants' National Bank, of Bur­lington, and the National State Bank, of Mount Pleasant, Iowa. <br>Mr. Blake has a beautiful home in this city, No. 902 College avenue, and, when not engrossed with business, is usually found there, happy in the society of his family. He was married July 4, 1867, to Miss Sarah Lucretia Hurd, daughter of James L. and Nancy (Green) Hurd. They have two daughters, Mrs. Eva B. Swan, wife of W. B. Swan, of Burlington, and Miss Lucretia Barnes Blake. His political views are in harmony with the principles advanced by the Republican party, to which party he has given his support ever since he was a voter.

"NI3654","Casper Clutter, was confirmed in the German village of Birkenau at the age of 14.  In 1709 he came with his father Johan Paulus Klotter, with other Palatine immigrants, down the Rhine to Rotterdam and across to London, where they are enumerated in the camps.  They came on to New York colony, but apparently the father must have died along the way, for the subsistence lists by the Govenor of NY show the widow Susanna and children.  In 1710 she (Casper's mother) remarried to Johan Poeler(Bohler) and they probably moved to upstate NY.  Casper however was old enough to be on his own, listed in the tax lists as a single man.  In 1715 he served in the NJ Militia.  He then Married Jannetje (Jane) --and they had two children baptized at the Dutch Church in Readington Township, Hunterdon Co., NJ, Paulus and Magdalena in 1724.

"NI4425","10th Earl of Dundonald<br>Thomas Cochrane, the son of the ninth Earl of Dundonald, was born in Annsfield, Lanarkshire in 1775. He was educated at home and after a brief spell at the Chauvet Military Academy in London, he joined the Royal Navy. Cochrane became captain of H.M.S. Speedy in 1800 and he soon established a reputation for his daring and brilliant seamanship against the French Navy.<br>Cochrane came into conflict with the authorities when they refused to support his campaign against corruption in the navy. In 1806 Thomas Cochrane met the radical journalist William Cobbett, who had also been involved in attempting to expose corruption in the armed forces. The two men became close friends and Cobbett encouraged Cochrane to win election to the House of Commons where he would have an opportunity to expose those members of the armed forces who were misusing their power.<br>Cochrane was elected to represent Honiton in 1806. However, Cochrane's ideas were too progressive for the electors of Honiton and in 1807 he decided to accept the invitation to stand with Sir Francis Burdett as one of the two Radical candidates for the Westminster constituency.<br>After his election to the House of Commons Captain Cochrane spent much of his time at sea in the war against the French. When in Parliament, Cochrane made several speeches attacking corruption in the Royal Navy. The naval authorities were furious with Cochrane and he demoted. Aware that he had lost the opportunity of advancing his naval career, Cochrane concentrated his efforts on campaigning for parliamentary reform.<br>In 1814 Cochrane was accused with his uncle and his stockbroker of fraud on the stock market. Cochrane claimed he had been framed but he was found guilty of fraud and sentenced to a year's imprisonment, a fine of £1,000 and two hours in the pillory. When Sir Francis Burdett threatened to stand next to Cochrane in the pillory, this part of the sentence was withdrawn to avoid a riot taking place.<br>After his release from prison Cochrane gave support to Major John Cartwright and the formation of the Hampden Clubs. He also argued in favour of universal suffrage and spoke against the Gagging Acts.<br>In 1818 Cochrane resigned from the House of Commons and took up an appointment as commander of the Chilean Navy. After periods working for the governments of Peru and Brazil, Cochrane took command of the naval force that had been formed to assist the liberation of Greece.<br>In 1831 Thomas Cochrane became the tenth Earl of Dundonald. The following year, King William IV awarded him a free pardon for his alleged role in the 1814 stock market fraud. He was also reinstated as a Rear Admiral in the Royal Navy. Thomas Cochrane, Earl of Dundonald, died on 31st October 1860.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------<br>(1) In his autobiography, Thomas Cochrane described how his defeat in the 1805 Honiton election led to his victory in the following year.<br>To the intense disgust of the majority of the electors, I refused to bribe at all, announcing my determination to stand on patriotic principles' which, in the electioneering parlance of those days, meant 'no bribery'. To my astonishment, however, a considerable number of the respectable inhabitants voted in my favour.<br>Having had decisive proof as to the nature of Honiton politics, I made up my mind that the next time there was a vacancy in the borough, the seat should be mine without bribery. Accordingly, immediately after my defeat, I sent the bellman round the town, having first primed him with an appropriate speech, intimating that all who had voted for me, might repair to my agent and receive ten pounds ten. The novelty of a defeated candidate paying double the current price expended by the successful one made a great sensation. The impression produced was simply this - that if I gave ten guineas for being beaten, my opponent had not paid half enough for being elected."

Illness forced him to leave the .service and come to Canada.<br>In his pretty log cottage at Shanty Bay he dwelt during the first years after his settlement, and his relations with the settlers of the neighbourhood were of the most friendly character.

O'Brien's life, as well as that of his wife, have been warmly eulogized by their contemporary generation. Their charitableness caused them to be respected by people of all shades of opinion ; and it is recorded that to Mrs O'Brien, Toronto is indebted for its first ragged school. Several members of their family became distinguished in various ways. Lieut.-Col. Wm. E. O'Brien was commanding officer of the 35th battalion, Simcoe Foresters, resigning October, 1897, and was member of the Dominion House of Commons for Muskoka ; Lucius R.

Connelley, Secretary of the Kansas State Historical Society, Topeka. Chicago: Lewis Publishing Company, copyright 1918; transcribed October, 1997.<br>HON. JOSEPH RALPH BURTON. Among the men who have come out of the Hoosier State to aid Kansas as in its real growth and development, there has been no finer man nor better citizen than Hon. Joseph Ralph Burton. Youthful in years as he was in experience when he came to Kansas in 1878, he plunged at once into the heart of affairs and gained ready recognition from the people. Senator Burton had at that time the ability to impress others with his reliability; he gained public confidence; he possessed the power of making people know that his talents were not merely skin deep but that they were solid, substantial and lasting. Nearly forty years have passed since he cast his fortunes with the workers w-ho have constructed the mighty commonwealth of the Sunflower and his reliability need not now be mentioned, it is so well known, the public confidence which he gained in his youth has been strengthened and solidified as the years have passed; his hold upon the people is strong and sure because of what he has done in their behalf. His record speaks for itself.<br>Joseph Ralph Burton was born on his father's farm near Mitchell, Lawrence County, Indiana, November 16, 1852, his parents being Allen C. and Elizabeth (Holmes) Burton. The Burton family, which is of English origin, was founded in America about the year 1750. John P. Burton, the great-grandfather of Joseph R. was a colonel of the Continental line in the war for American independence, and Hutchinson Burton, a brother of the colonel, was a member of the Continental Congress from Virginia. William Burton, son of Col. John P. Burton and grandfather of Joseph Ralph Burton, was born near Asheville, North Carolina. He was a pioneer settler of Lawrence, County, Indiana, locating near Mitchell in the year 1830, and subsequently engaging in farming. A democrat in politics, he was active in the civic life of the community and served several terms in the Indiana State Legislature. Allen C. Burton, his son, was born near Lexington, Kentucky, and went with his parents to Indiana. Like his father he was a farmer. Originally a Douglas democrat, he became later a Lincoln republican.<br>Joseph Ralph Burton received his elementary education in the district schools of his native county. He pursued an academic course of study at Mitchell Seminary, of which his father was one of the founders, and which at that time was conducted by a relative, the Rev. Simpson Burton. He matriculated at Franklin College, at Franklin, Indiana, under the special tutelage of Lincoln Wayland, the late editor of the National Baptist, of Philadelphia, and after completing a three-year course entered De Pauw University, Greencastle, Indiana. While in the university he paid his own expenses by teaching elocution. Becoming dangerously ill in the middle of his senior year, he was forced to leave college without receiving his academic degree.<br>After leaving De Pauw, Senator Burton read law in the offices of the celebrated firm of Gordon, Browne & Lamb, of Indianapolis, and was admitted to the bar in that city in July, 1875, and at once located for the practice of his profession at Princeton, in the same state. During the campaign of 1876, before he had cast his first presidential vote, he made a three-months' speaking campaign for the national ticket under the auspices of the Republican National Committee, and was on the electoral ticket.<br>Attracted by the greater opportunities offered to young men in the West, Senator Burton located at Abilene, Dickinson County, Kansas, in 1878. There he formed, with John H. Mahan, the law firm of Mahan & Burton, which soon acquired a large practice Like most young lawyers, Mr. Burton took an active interest in politics, and in 1882 had so far advanced in public confidence that he was elected a member of the Kansas Legislature. With his colleague, the Hon. C. B. Hoffman, he at once became interested in railway legislation. The members-elect were called together in a sort of rump session at Abilene previous to the regular sitting. The call for this caucus of legislators was signed by C. B. Hoffman, A. P Collins, G. W. Martin and J. R. Burton, and the efforts of Mr. Burton and his associates resulted in the organization of the first railway commission in Kansas. He was a member of the house judiciary committee during his first session in the Legislature. He was re-elected in the year 1884 and during the session of 1885, as chairman of the committee on county seats and county lines, had charge of the making of many new counties in Southeastern Kansas. He was recognized as the leader of the Kansas House of Representatives. In the year 1886 he was a candidate for the republican nomination for Congress in the Fifth District, and after a heated campaign, in which Hon. John A. Anderson, the incumbent, took part, came within two votes of a nomination, a dark horse, the Hon. A. S. Wilson, really winning. While campaigning for the republican national ticket in the State of Maine, in the year 1888, Senator Burton was nominated and elected for his third term in the Legislature. He was the house leader of his party in the session of 1889 and declined all committee appointments. He introduced and secured the passage of an anti-trust bill, which became a law in 1889. What was substantially a copy of this law was passed by Congress in June, 1890, and has become well known as the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. The Kansas measure was the first bill of this kind to become a law in the United States. In a speech before the republican state convention held at Topeka in the year 1890, Senator Burton foretold the disastrous overflow that befell the republican party in the elections of that year. This speech, for a time, made him unpopular, but after the election his words of warning were remembered. In 1891 he spoke in a series of joint debates with Senator William A. Peffer, who had been elected by a combination of populists and democrats. These debates attracted attention throughout the country and resulted in Senator Burton's nomination for Congress in the Fifth District the following year. He made his campaign for Congress in a district with a majority of more than 9,000 against him, spent five months on the stump, and was defeated by less than 1,300 votes. Although defeated, his campaign was the means of restoring his district to the republican party. In the year 1894 he was a candidate for the United States Senate and there were some other aspirants against him. He was also opposed by the republican national committeeman from Kansas and by the entire regular organization of the party, and was defeated in the party caucus by one vote, the nomination going to Lucien Baker, a dark horse in the contest. He was again a contestant for the Senate in 1896, he and the late Senator John J. Ingalls being the recognized candidates. Senator Burton defeated Ingalls by a vote of more than seven to one in the caucus of his party, but the Legislature was carried by the democrats and the Hon. W. A. Harris was chosen senator.<br>In the campaign of the year 1898, although a private citizen, Mr. Burton was recognized as the leader of his party, and largely through his efforts the republicans were restored to power in Kansas. In the year 1900 Senator Lucien Baker was a candidate for re-election, but, was easily defeated by Senator Burton, who was the unanimous choice of the republican caucus.<br>Senator Burton's service in the United States Senate is chiefly noted for his uncompromising opposition to the Cuban Bill, which sailed under the name of Cuban Reciprocity. In his stand on this measure, which he believed to be unwise, unjust to the people and .dangerous to the interests of his state Senator Burton incurred the displeasure of President Theodore Roosevelt, the organized commercial interests, and especially of the notorious sugar trust. The enemies he made in the Senate in the defense of the industries and resources of Kansas, finally caused his retirement and embarrassed him financially. After his retirement from public life he returned to Abilene engaged in business, and soon acquired a comfortable fortune. In the year 1907 he bought the Central Kansas Publishing Company, of which he and his wife are the controlling owners, and purchased the Salina Daily Union, which he has since conducted. In this paper Senator Burton seeks to teach the members of both the great parties the true principles of democracy as opposed to autocracy, which, as he views it, has gained a dangerous foothold in the republic.<br>Senator Burton married, October 10, 1875, Mrs. Carrie Webster, daughter of Dr. E. V. Mitchell, of New Harmony, Indiana. Mrs. Burton is related to the leading families of that famous colony immortalized by Lord Byron in Childe Harold. The Senator and Mrs. Burton have no children, but havc generously assisted in the education of several nephews and nieces. Mrs. Burton is one of thc most brilliant and versatile women in Kansas, as well as one of the most beloved. She has been a co-worker with her husband in all his enterprises, as well as in his public life. She enjoys the distinction of being the only United States senator's wife who has never had her picture taken. The family became residents of Salina in April, 1910."

A. Tolliver came from Lawrence County, Ind., to this township in 1838, and the next year entered eighty acres of land in Section 34, where he now resides. He is a native of Huntsville, Ala., but was principally reared in Indiana, where he was also married to Frances Burton, daughter of David Burton. She was the mother of twelve children, of whom eight are now living--Wesley G., George W., John, William H., Martin, Robert, Sarah Rains and Mary J. Steel, all of whom, with the exception of Wesley G., now a resident of Christian County, and Martin, a resident of Arkansas, are living in Clay County. Mr. and Mrs. Tolliver are members of the Baptist Church. He has served many years as a detective, and his life abounds with many interesting events fraught with danger. His father, John Tolliver, was a native of North Carolina, where he married Salona C. Miller, by whom he had twelve children; of these eleven reached maturity. He came to Blair Township in the fall of 1839, and died here. Numerous descendants are yet living in this county."
"NI8762","The following notes were taken from a story that Thurlow and Estelle's daughter, Joy, wrote:<br>Thurlow and Estelle bought an 80 acre farm in 1918 or 1919 from Carl Ogden for $2000.00.  Their house had 2 large rooms, with a step-down room in back that served as kitchen and dining room.  In the early 1930's, Thurlow built a new home on the property.  This house was mostly financed by a bonus that Thurlow had received for his services in World War I. The bonus was around $400 to $500.  With this money, he bought the old Harmony school house, hauling it home in a wagon and using it to build the new house.  The new house had a living room, dining room, kitchen and two bedrooms.  There was no bathroom.  Electricity came much later. The family was poor, but most other families in the area at that time were too.  They always had enough to eat and wear.  It may not have been what they liked, but they made do.  Thurlow farmed for a living, and did some carpentry work (for $1.50 a day).  He raised peaches a few years as a cash crop.  But, most of the crops he grew was either food for the family, or something for the farm animals to eat, such as corn, peas, peanuts and hay.  The family usually had a few eggs and cream to sell to help pay for the groceries.  Other times they would have a few chickens to sell, or occasionally a cow or calf.  The daughters had to go after the cows daily for milking. <br>The washing was done at a well away from the house in the hog pasture, because the water in the house was too hard.  Sometimes they would have to chase a hog to retrieve a bar of P&G soap that it had snatched. Clothes were washed on a rub board, in water that had been heated in a wash pot.  Then the clothes were boiled in the wash pot, especially the white things.  The next day after washing, hours were spent ironing, with irons that were heated either on the stove or in the fireplace.  Estelle always used Faultless starch and Ball Blue bluing. <br>The children went barefoot during the summer when they were small, and even to school until it turned cold.  In the wintertime they wore long underwear, and long cotton stockings over the underwear, until the girls got old enough to rebel.  Jeans or long pants for girls were unheard of then. <br>The children slept on mattresses made of straw (hay), but Thurlow and Estelle did have a cotton mattress.  There was also a feather mattress on one bed. <br>Thurlow took the daily newspaper the Arkansas Democrat, and sometimes he would get the weekly Kansas City Star.  The Kansas City Star had a quilt block pattern in it that Estelle always saved.  Estelle would subscribed to a magazine now and then, if the salesman who came by would except a hen or two as payment. <br>Thurlow liked to play Solitaire, and work hard crossword puzzles.  On Saturdays he went to Harmony and played Rook (the card game) all afternoon.  His partner was usually Mr. Henry Gotcher and they were supposedly hard to beat. <br>If Thurlow was asked to do something he didn't want to do, he would say I've got a bone in my leg. <br>There were two stores at Harmony, J.R. Porter's and Ferrell King's. Thurlow did his trading with Ferrell.  It really was trading, because cream and eggs, or whatever, would be traded for groceries.  The Harmony post office was in Porter's store, and in another corner cream was tested.  The men played their Rook games in back, sitting on bags of feed."
"NI8764","The following notes were taken from a brief life story that Joy wrote about herself:<br>Joy and her sisters went to school at Lone Pine for the first 8 years. They always walked to school, alone, with no adult supervision. Lone Pine was a typical one-room school house with a pot-bellied stove in the center. It had a stage across the back with blackboards and a recitation bench in front of the seats where each class went for their lessons. The wall at back had hooks for caps and coats, and on the floor beneath the lunch buckets rested. The school had about 30 or 40 students at a time, from 1st through 8th grade all in one. The boys sat on one side of the room and the girls on the other. The larger students sat at the back, and the smallest in front. They got their water from an outside pump, which sometimes had to be primed first. The school bell that called them in for recess was later moved to the Court House Square in Clarksville. At this writing (in 2001) the bell was still there.<br>During Joy's attendance at Lone Pine, her teachers were, Mr. E.F. Brazil for the first 3 years, ,then Mr. N.T. Griffith, then Mrs. Ella Sue Bennett, and last Mr. Virgil Day. Her best friend at school was Mavis King. Joy and her sisters carried their lunches to school wrapped in newspaper. Lunch usually consisted of a biscuit or two, with possibly a piece of sausage or an egg to put between the bread. Their mother made cookies often, so they would bring cookies with them, too.<br>The saddest time of Joy's growing up years was the year her sister died (1935). Wilma (who was a twin) died at the age of 8 of pneumonia. Joy was only 11 at the time, and their oldest sister was 12. Other sad times were the death of Winfred Bennett, a school mate, and the son of the teacher, Ella Sue Bennett. He was about 11 when he died, around the same age as Joy. Another teacher at the school, Mr. Griffith, also lost a child, a son who was about 2 or 3.<br>After Joy and her sisters finished the 8th grade at Lone Pine, they went to Clarksville High School. The girls had to walk about 2 miles to the Harmony stores, where they could catch the school bus. They made Porter's store their pit stop. Ameretta and Beatrice Basham and Iladean Frost walked with them most of the time. And, Hazel Breeden part of the time. Occasionally if it was raining hard, or there was snow on the ground, the girls would stay the night with friends to avoid the 2 mile walk home. Joy and her peers were among the first girls from Lone Pine to attend high school in Clarksville. Some of her teachers at Clarksville were Miss Pauline Michie, Miss Era King and Bell Metheny in the 9th grade. And, later there were Miss Maude Agee, Chester Mattox, Miss Bertha Lee, Burley Kinney, Eula Taylor, Hugh Miracle, Mrs. Misenheimer and Izola Strong Taylor. The school building burned the year Joy was a sophomore. They had classes in church basements scattered around town that year until they built another school.<br>Joy was married to Junior Bean when she was 18 years old. They built a home in the Harmony community north west of Clarksville, Arkansas. They had a good life together, raising 4 sons and 2 daughters. Joy never worked. She was always a stay-at-home mom. Junior died of cancer when he was 60 years old, and Joy was 59. After his death, she remained a widow, living alone for the next 18 years. She had never learned to drive, so family members and friends had to take her to church and the doctor and the grocery store, etc., once Junior had passed on. Joy died at the age of 77. She had had her big family Christmas dinner in 2001, and most of the family was there. Then, 3 days after Christmas she had a fall in her home. She hit her head hard enough to cause internal bleeding in her brain, but did not tell anyone that she needed medical care."
"NI8765","The following notes were taken from a story that Junior's wife, Joy, wrote about their lives:<br>Junior was born in Mt. Zion, Arkansas, but his family moved to Lone Pine (by Spadra Creek) when he was about in the 5th grade. After 2 or 3 years, they moved on to Harmony to care for Mrs. Bean's father, Will Porter.<br>When Junior and Joy got married, it was about 4 months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and about 6 weeks before she graduated from high school. They had known each other since about 5th grade. They were married at a preacher's house, and they lived with Junior's parents for about the first year. At the time of their marriage Pearl Harbor seemed a distant thing, but 2 years later, Junior was into it. By the time their first child, Dennis Wayne, was born in 1943, they were sharing a house on the Robert Laster place (north of the Harmony church) with Junior's brother, Heartsill, and his wife Lottie. With the war on (WW2), Junior was expecting to be drafted at any time, so he just went down and enlisted instead. He left in February of 1944, and Joy and her baby son Dennis went back to live with her parents for the duration. He was stationed first at Shepherd Field, near Wichita Falls, Texas for his basic training. From there he went to Keestler Field at Biloxi, Mississippi, then to Long Beach, California, then to Knobnoster, Missouri and finally to Pope Field, Fayetteville, N. Carolina.<br>Junior came home for the birth of his 2nd child, daughter Dianne, in October of 1945, and when he got back to base his unit had shipped out overseas. The war was already over, so he never did have to go overseas. However, he didn't make it back home with a discharge until May of 1946.<br>After the war, they first lived in a house belonging to Claude Elkins. They had only lived there a few months when they bought a house from Junior's brother Heartsill and his wife Lottie. The house sat on 1 acre in the north east corner of Junior's father's place. That was to be their permanent home, except for the times when they left to work elsewhere, a few months at a time. They paid about $900 for the house and 1 acre. Their 2nd child, Dianne, was about 1 year old when they first moved there. The house had a living room, one average size bedroom that always had 2 beds in it, a smaller bedroom that had room for a bed and not much else, and the kitchen. Joy cooked on a wood stove, which was considered a great improvement over the small kerosene stove she had used the first year or two of their marriage. She has said that she knew almost nothing about cooking when they first married. Her first attempt at a pie ended up in the slop bucket.<br>Junior and Joy's first car was a white 1932 Model A Ford, which they bought soon after Junior came home from the Army. They sold it later to Phil Pierson, and it was also his first car. The only new car they ever had was a white 1965 Chevrolet pickup which Junior was still driving when he died in 1983. The purchase price was around $2000.<br>About 1948 Junior worked at sawmilling. His brother, Heartsill, owned the saw mill. The men built about 5 or 6 crude cabins that they lived in during the summer. They were back in the mountains on Bear Branch in northwestern Arkansas. (From Clarksville, take highway 103 north to the top of the mountain, out across the top and then partway down the other side. Currently, in 2001, Joy and Junior's son, James Norman Bean, lives just north of this area, about a mile or two.) Besides Joy and Junior and their children, and Heartsill and Lottie and their children, others staying in this group of cabins were Joy's sister, Beth, and her husband Lee Newton, and Morris and Theda Cobb. Bob and Emma Dell Leeds were there part of the time.<br>Junior went to agricultural school on the G.I. Bill in about 1949."
"NI8780","                FAMILY HISTORY OF TARLTON LEWIS<br>                         1805 - 1890<br>     Tarlton Lewis, first Bishop of Salt Lake City was born 18 May 1805, in Pendleton District, South Carolina. Tarlton was the fourth child in a family of 12 children, born to Neriah Lewis and Mary Moss.<br>     In 1809 the Lewis family moved to Kentucky, here Tarlton grew up and fell in love with Malinda Gimlin, the daughter of Samuel Gimlin and Elizabeth Moore. These two were wed 27 Oct 1829. A Little girl whom they named Mary was born Sep 10, 1831.<br>     The Lewis family moved to Macopin Co., llinois where Beason Lewis was born 19 Feb 1836.<br>     Tarlton and Malinda were baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day-Saints, 25 Jul 1836, by Benjamin Lewis, brother of Tarlton. Three of his brothers joined the Church in Caldwell County, Missouri. Here they endured the persecutions meted out to the saints by the mobs.<br>     From Archiebald Bennett's Lesson booklet entitled, Adventures in Research, we read, On Oct 30, 1838 at a place called Haun's Mill on Shoal Creek in Missouri; a group of Mormon families had settled. Among them were three brothers, Benjamin, Tarlton and David. Angry mobs were threatening them from several settlements and the brothern met in council to decide what course of to pursue to defend themselves against the mob threatening them with killings and house burnings. About 28 of the men were armed and in readiness to defend themselves against a small body of men who might come down upon them. The children were playing on both sides of the creek, the mothers were engaged in domestic activities and the fathers stood guard in the mill and other properties. The sun shown clear and all was in tranquillity.<br>     About four O'Clock a large company of armed men approached on horses and started firing about a hundred rifles upon Haun's Mill. Tarlton and Benjamin were wounded. Benjamin's wife gathered her children and took to the woods and stayed there all night. Benjamin had managed to nearly get to his house, he was taken in and his wounds cared for and he lived till early morning. He coughed up the bullet he was wounded with. His wife got home from the woods before he died and Benjamin asked her to keep the children in the Church together and to stay with them and then expired.<br>     Returning to the blacksmith shop, they found eight already dead, and several expiring; in jeopardy of their own lives, expecting to be fired upon any time they gathered up the dead bodies of their loved ones and threw them into an old well. Benjamin was buried in a grave dug by his brother Tarlton. (Malinda, Tarlton's wife, as small as she was, with the help of Benjamin's wife did most of the digging. Tarlton was already wounded in the shoulder and he carried the bullet to the grave.)<br>     There was one Isaac Laney who was shot in the abdomen and his intestines were falling out, Malinda took off her kitchen apron and bound it around his stomach to keep thing in place, they managed to get him to the Lewis home before the mob returned. Malinda saw them coming and hid Tarlton under the house. The mob searched the house and upon seeing Mr. Laney decided he was too near dead to waste a bullet on. They left never knowing the whereabouts of Tarlton. After they were gone, Malinda wondered what she could find to cleanse their wounds. She knelt down beside her husband's bed and prayed to the Lord for help, as she didn't know what to do next. When she finished her prayer, she opened her eyes, she noticed some white ashes lying on the hearth. This seemed the answer to her prayers. She gathered the ash and soaked it in water, with this water she used to bathe the wounds of both men. For weeks she nursed these men and was successful in bringing them back to health. YES! Mr. Laney recovered and came to Utah with the Saints. David the other brother escaped unharmed. Despite this shocking tragedy the two surviving brothers never lost faith in the Gospel, soon others of the Lewis family were converted and baptized.<br>     In the year 1839 the family moved to Quincy, Illinois. In Oct 1839, they moved to Commerce, later called Nauvoo. Here Tarlton was set apart as Bishop of the Nauvoo 4th Ward by the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum Smith, they also ordained him a High Priest. Their son Edward was born 3 Jan 1840.<br>     Tarlton loved the Prophet Joseph Smith. On Jun 5, 1831 he and several other men learned that the Prophet was in danger of being abducted, boarded a skiff and went to Quincy in order to rescue him. They arrived too late for they found he had been taken to Nauvoo in Company of the officers.<br>     Tarlton Lewis spent nine months in the Black Hills getting out timbers for the erection of the Nauvoo Temple. He had charge of the crane used in hoisting the material for the erection of the Temple. He was also very skilled as a cabinet maker and carpenter. He and eight other men and Brigham Young hoisted the last stone into it's place thus finishing the Temple. Tarlton and Malinda had their Endowments on the 17th of Dec 1845 and were sealed in this Temple for time and all eternity 6 Feb 1846.<br>     On the 26th of June 1846 the Mormon Battalion was organized. Tarlton's oldest son Samuel being only 16 years old. He signed up in Company C. This proved to be a terrible blow to his father, and it is said that Tarlton's hair turned gray almost over night. Samuel was born Oct 27, 1829. On that date of 1829 he would have been 17 years, but he joined the Battalion about four months before he was 17 years old. Age 18 was the official age to join. We can see how the father must have felt at seeing his young son go into the services so young, the youngest of all but one man and that one was named Lott Smith.<br>     The winter of 1846 was spent at Winter Quarters, where the Saints suffered much from cold and hunger. Little Edward tagged along one day when his mother went to the river where they got their water for their house use. When the mother returned with her two buckets for more water, she thought Edward was still coming up the hill toward home, but she could see nothing of him. He was supposed to have been carrying his little brass bucket full of water, but couldn't be found; a hole had been chopped in the ice to draw out the water, and there was the little brass bucket beside the hole, but no Edward to be found. They walked the banks of the river for weeks trying to find the boy's body, but they never find it; it is supposed that Edward tried to dip water out of the hole and slipped in. It cast a gloom over the family. It was here in Winter Quarters that Tarlton Lewis, Jr. was born 23 Dec 1846 to his large family.<br>     Leaving his family camped on a covered wagon at Winter Quarters. He came to Utah with Brigham Young, as one of the original Pioneers to Utah on the 16th of Apr 1847. He was asked to be Captain over 50 wagons. He took charge of the ox teams and other jobs along the trail. They arrived in Salt Lake Valley the 24th of July 1847. He was asked to act first Bishop of Salt Lake City, a position which he held until the saints were organized into five Bishop Wards. Later, Tarlton was asked to serve as 2nd Councilor to Edward Hunter of the 13th Ward.<br>     Please Note: Ruel Smith, son of Hyrum and Laura Smith while doing research work in the big library in Cedar City, Utah found the following and copied it. From Andrew Jensens History is this note: `Under the direction of Bishop Tarlton Lewis, the brethren of the valley continued their labors on the houses which were being created in the stockades known as Pioneer Square. New Pioneer Park.. Most of these houses were built in the interest of immigration. More people were soon expected to arrive from the east.'<br>     In the year 1848, Tarlton went with Brigham Young and party back to Winter Quarters with supplies to meet the immigrants. Here he found his own family just as he had left them. He brought them back to Utah with him.<br>     Martha Lewis was born the 10th of July 1849 in Salt Lake City, Utah.<br>     In Dec of 1850, Tarlton lewis accompanied George A. Smith to Iron County, where they settled in Parowan, Utah. This was the beginning of the settlements in Southern Utah. Tarlton was soon made Bishop of that town. From the diary of George A. Smith we read- Sunday, Dec 15, 1850, Bishop Tarlton Lewis assisted by the brethren made a large campfire in the center of the corral, by request a general meeting was opened by singing and prayer was given by Bishop Tarlton Lewis. A call was made for the Bishops to come forward and answer to their names. This took place on the Provo River.<br>     Monday morning, Jan 20, 1851, Bishop Lewis and nine other men started up the canyon to cut timber for a new meeting house.<br>     Tuesday 1851, Bishop Lewis and three other men commenced farming the mill.<br>     Friday, May 16, 1851, Tarlton Lewis appointed 2nd Alderman on the City Council.<br>     On June 17, 1852 another boy was born to this household, they named him Ephriam Lewis<br>     In 1858, Tarlton Lewis and Isaac Grundy, Jesse N. Smith and William Barton were sent to explore Beaver Valley; while working in this territory they discovered rich deposits of lead and iron in the mountains. Specimens were taken to Brigham Young and the specimens caused quite a bit of excitement. These men were ordered to open the mines and lay out a townsite. Minersville was settled in 1859. With the arrival of the first families, the Lincoln Mine was opened and a company formed with Isaac Grundy as President and Samuel Lewis, oldest son of Tarlton was one of the Directors and others who were: William Barton, John Blackburn, James H. Rawlins, and Silas S. Smith.<br>     At one time the settlers needed a pea made to use with their steelyards used in weighing their commodities, (pea- the sliding weight used on a steelyard, safety-valve, etc.) Several men went upon the mountain and were able to get lead so rich that they melted and separated the lead over a pine fire. On the 24th of May, Tarlton Lewis and Brinkerhoff took a walk to Red Breaks. They took their spades along, excavated a mound, found an adobe wall, some human bones, and timber.<br>     Elizabeth (Reese) Graig, (a great grand-mother of yours) a friend of the Lewis family, used to relate this story. She said when they moved into the same neighborhood that the Lewis family lived in, they didn't have much to eat. They were very poor and worked all day on the old house they were moving into. It was full of cracks, broken windows, and not much good. It was cold and they worked very hard all day without a bite to eat. So when evening came they were wondering what they could eat to ease their hunger when a knock came to their door. Opening it Tarlton Lewis and his wife walked in with a basket full of food, a huge beef roast, a pot of beans and a large loaf of not bread with a bowl of fresh butter. They all sat down to the best tasting food she had ever ate. She thought Tarlton Lewis was the best man she ever knew. They lived close to them for years. She said the Lewis's had a good comfortable home, lots of milk cows, chickens and other farm animals, a well kept farm, a garden, a strawberry patch and a lovely fruit orchard, in fact he raised most of everything the family needed. She said the Lewis's had a good comfortable home, and kept his place so clean of weeds that he had to get weeds for his pigs from the neighbors. He was a big man and had a big tummy which made it hard for him to stoop so he got down on his hands and knees to pull the weeds out of his garden. She said that she believed that he gave more food away to the needy than he kept for himself.<br>     Malinda Lewis was the first President of the Relief Society in Minersville. On Apr 16, 1859, her husband donated the lot to build the hall on.<br>     Tarlton and family lived in Minersville for about 14 years, then with some of their children and some of their families and others moved to Jo City often called Jo Town. It was here they lived the United Order for a few years. Later they moved to Richfield, Sevier County, Utah. On the 16th of July 1877, Tarlton was set apart as Bishop of 2nd Ward of Richfield under the hands of Erastus Snow and Orson Hyde. This position he held slightly more than a year. His health forced him to resign. They many sufferings he had endured along with the saints and the wound and the bullet he carried in his shoulder all these years was telling on him, and he was a man of 73 years old. He was made Bishop in most every community he lived in. Although he was a very large man, he was very active and hard worker. Tarleton usually weighed 300 lbs. and more, but all his life was spent in the service of the Church, it's cause and progress. Tarleton and Malinda Gimlin were the parents of eight children. They will be heirs to a great posterity. From a second marriage there were two sons, William and Benjamin. There are numerous descendants from these boys, also who have lived and raised their families in Circleville, Piute County, Utah.<br>     Tarlton was a real Pioneer, always helping to find new towns, making reservoirs, clearing new land and encouraging people to build and build well. He was always on the frontier. He was a colorful figure in early days of southern Utah. It is said Tarlton gave away more than he kept for himself. This family was dearly loved by all their neighbors. He was often referred to as The Grand Old Man.  All his life was spent in the service of building up Zion.<br>     Tarlton died at the ranch home of his son Beason on Fish Creek near Teasdale, Wayne County, Utah, 22, Nov 1890 and was buried in Teasdale Cemetery.<br>     (taken from, History of Iron County Mission and Parowan Colonization - part I by Eugenie R. Hunt, p 27 in poss of Mr. Ted L. Moody, Safford, Az).<br>     Malinda Gimlin Lewis was the daughter of Samuel Gimlin and Elizabeth Moore. She was born 27 Mar 1811 in Cumberlin County, Kentucky. She fell in love with Tarlton Lewis and they were married 27 Mar 1828. The lives of these two good Grandparents of ours are so closely woven together that the story of one is the story of them both.<br>     Right here I want to put in a clause about the Gimlin Family. I have lately ran into a cousin of ours living in Clarksville, Arkansas, she is a Catholic and has a definite hatred for Mormons, but will answer my letters as long as I leave out religion and dont send her any literature. She has sent me allot of Gimlin records and some pictures of our relatives on the Gimlin and Moore side. I'm so happy to get them. I have two of Malinda's brothers pictures I never expected to find and some records and history, so I am proud of my little cousin Tugie Baxter. Cousin Tugie told me how bad she felt when Tarlton married Malinda. Her brothers threatened to whip Tarlton and all that prevented them from doing it was the size of Tarlton. They were afraid of him. The whole family were opposed to it and have hated the Mormons ever since. Tugie is a widow; had 14 children then her husband left her and married another woman. Tugie is devoted to Jesus as anyone can be. She regrets that Malinda didn't stay with her brother's church. David was his name and he was a great preacher and had a great following and if Malinda had stayed with him she could of had a high position in it; but she lost her chance when she married that Mormon. Malinda was a small woman as were all the Gimlins; they were a small tribe, I guess. She only weighed about 100 lbs. and when she stood beside Tarlton, he sitting down, she and him were about the same height. It can be said of Malinda, she was one of the kindest persons that ever lived. She was ever on the lookout for ways to help those in need, it seemed that she knew just when her neighbors needed her help the most and would appear on the scene at the right time to do the most good. This attribute gained for her many lasting friends. Even after she passed away those incidents of her helpfulness were told and retold to her posterity by those who knew her personally. That her posterity of today may get some idea of her looks, she was a very thin and tiny woman with beautiful dark hair and eyes. What she lacked in size, she made up in sweetness and energy. Thus her memory will live forever and be revealed by each generation of her family as they come along. Malinda died at Richfield, Utah, 5th June 1894 and was buried there.<br>     Here is a statement made by Tarlton Lewis at a meeting being held in Southern Utah, just before the Mountain Meadow Massacre: he being the Bishop in Parowan.<br>     Brother Lewis then reviewed the remarks of the previous speaker (who was Lot Smith) then said this: All good and for good, all the scenes that Brother Lot has recounted I shared in Missouri. My brother was killed in Missouri and I am alive to avenge his blood when the Lord wills. The second time I heard a Mormon preach he declared holding up a Book of Mormon that this is a record of the Red Men, and of Gods' dealings with their forefathers, and that one day we should carry this book to the indians. We are now living among them to carry this work to them. We must treat them like children to quite their savage ways. Shall we have no opportunities? We shall! No conquest without a struggle. No victory without a fight. Be diligent and faithful and patient, and the Lord will reward you when you have been proved. Ephraim is the battle ax of the Lord. May we not have been sent to learn how to use this ax with skill?<br>     (the original of this journal is in the archives of the LDS Church)<br>     When Tarlton was a small boy he was afraid of ghosts, he had to bring in the cows and it was generally dark before they were all gathered in, so he told his father he didn't want to go after the cows. Well, said his father next time you see a ghost I tell you what to do, pick up a big stick and walk right up to the thing and hit it hard and you will never be scared again. Tarlton had always loved and obeyed his father, so one night sure enough he could see a ghost through the big trees as he was in the forest, his first impulse was to run, then he remembered what his father had told him so he found a big stick and with trembling hands and knees shaking he walked right up to the ghost, and there stood one of the old milk cows with a little new white calf walking around her. it was a lesson Tarlton never forgot, and he never was afraid of ghosts anymore.<br>         THE FAMILY OF TARLTON LEWIS AND MALINDA GIMLIN<br>     Tarlton Lewis, b. 18 May 1805 in Pendleton Distric, Andrsn, S- Cr, son of Neriah and Mary Moss, md.

"NI8796","STORY OF MALINDA GIMLIN LEWIS<br>AS TOLD BY HER CHILDREN, EDWARD, IDA AND JUNE MOODY. <br>Malinda Gimlin Lewis was born 10 Sep 1866, in Minersville Utah. Her parents were Samue l Lewis and Sarah Jane Huntsman.<br>Not much is known of the doings in the childhood days of Malinda we will tell tell a few incidents of her early life as she has told it to her children.<br>June Moody, daughter of Malinda says, As I remember mother she was slender built had bl ue grey eyes, dark brown hair which hung to her waist and she could even sit on it. I remember combing her hair many times, it was beautiful when it hung over her shoulders, or done up in a big bob at the back of her head. I always thought my mother was a beautiful woman. I never remember of her ever scolding me but once, she had made Glenna and I a pretty white dress for the 4th of July. We wore those dresses to church on Sunday and were to change them in the afternoon to keep them lovely for a celebration the next day. We went home with some of our cousins after church and wore the dresses all day. Naturally getting them messed up for the 4th and mother scolded us for not changing them properly. Mother had a beautiful voice voice she could sing so clear and high. I did love to hear her sing.<br>Back to Utah-Mother said when they lived in Panguitch it was so cold they had to chop th rough three feet of ice to get water for the cattle to drink, and cut out the tree tops to feed them. While the family was eating breakfast one morning. Brother Trajo knocked at the door and was let in. Father asked him how he was. Trajo said I don't know, my horse all die my cow all die, got two wagon, guess they no die, sell one to get a little mut, to get a little grease, to make a little gravy, maybe so maybe so no. I don't know<br>It is told of Aunt Keturah that once when she road a horse down town and got home she wa s so cold she couldent get off her horse, without help, and the reins were frozen in her fingers and they had to be pried out, it was so bitter cold. The family always said Panguitch was the coldest spot on earth, and they were thinking of selling out and moving to a warmer climate.<br>When mother was a girl she and some neighbor children went swimming in a lake, she sudde nly began to sink as it was very deep, having been taught to prey , she began to prey to the Lord for help.she was inspired to hold her hands close to her sides and stiffen her body, as she did so her body shot up to the surface and she was saved from drowning. It might not work for others but it worked for her.<br>In December our family decided to sell our home and move to Arizona, it was almost tragic to part with home and friends so dear. but it was done and in the latter part of December when everything was disposed of and wagons packed and everything in readiness they said their goodbys and started south, snow was deep and so cold but they dident mind that. It was a long hard journey but our parents were used to hardships an so they took it all in its stride. All their earthly goods were packed in two strong wagons, one pulled by a team of horses the other by ox team with brother Oliver the driver, the other boys walking most of the way driving the live stock, It tells of the trouble getting over the river at Lees Ferry and hardships along the way, so it will be omitted here.<br>The Lewis family was given a corner lot in Pima to make their home, and at first they li ved in wagon boxes and sheds made of willows later log houses were built and the family was more comfortable. It was while here the children went to school and attended church and other organizations.<br>April 8 1881 being Founders Day in this small town of Pima, it being the date of the fir st families to enter this town, and it was celebrated in good old fashioned way by a gettogather with sports and games with a big program. Now this happened in April,and on May 1st the people cellebrated May Day on May 1st at this time they had a queen and maids and they ruled the day,Sarah Weech was crowned queen and Malinda Lewis was one of the maids,these girls were all dressed in white and of corse were the prettiest girls in town,or at least one young fellow that though so,this young man was Winfred Moody,when he first set eyes on Malinda he fell for her,he took her to several dances,and socials,and finely took her to his home to meet his parents,by car?no by buggy?no , she got up behind him on a horse and they went riding to his home in fine style.This May Day was held in a cottonwood grove just east of the town of Pima,a pretty spot covered with grass and so shady.It was the first May Day party ever held in the Gila valley,and these two young people always remembered when their life together first began.Malinda was fifteen years old( she was too young to be going out boys but they dident think so) Winfred was proud to introduce his girlfriend to his Pa and Ma. This romance continued for a long time Malinda and Winfred both joined the choir and enjoyed the practices very much as both were good singers,and there wasent too much entertainment in those days,Malinda's sister Laura also joined and the girls both had beautiful voices so these went to school that winter sang in the choir and during this time the romance between Winfred and Malinda ripened into something stronger and when Malinda's lover ask for her hand she gave it freely.<br>Now history says this Pima choir was preparing songs and music for the Latter Day Sain t Conference which was to be held in Snowflake,in october 1882this being the headquarters of the Stake at this time,she sister Laura was in love with the choir leader and both she and her sister Malinda were going to make this trip to help sing,and then go on to St. George to be married in the Temple there.and about the first of September this party of singers were ready to make the trip by team and wagon that long trip back to Utah in the fall.<br>After the conference was over most of the choir members returned home,and a number of th em made the trip on to St. George. The roads werent too good the weather cold and they had some worries but the trip was made safely,and these couples were married and sealed in the Temple for time and all eternity, Mother was sick most all the way she had chills and fever,the elders would administer to her and she would rest fine for awhile then she would be worseagain it was to bad to spoil their fun like that,all the way,Grandma was along she helped what she could but it seemed these chills had to run their course and after they reached St. George they had to wait a week before Malinda was able to go through the Temple,by the way mother already had her endowments when she was 14 years old and father had his so all they had to do was go and be sealed. There was J.K. Rogers taking two girls to have sealed to him, Eli Dodge to marry Amanda Reynolds and several others who went with this group on to St. George to be married in the Temple. After it was all over they returned home but not all together, our group stopped at night along the way with friends who lived on ranches along the road people they had known while they lived in Utah, they were always welcome, stayed nights with them ate with them and were given horse feed, and the evenings were spent in singing and dancing. And thus late in December they all returned home safely.<br>Now our parents are back in the Gila Valley the next thing was to build a home. Histor y says Pa and Ma built a little shack on his homestead. Winfred had taken up some land, and the job now was to clear it and get it ready for farming, there was a little spring of water about 100 yards from the shack.Grandfather had died about three years before and left father 20 acres of land as his part of the family estate.<br>During these years three children had blessed the home of this coupleand father was tryi ng hard to get his land in condition to make a living on. One day while he was at work down below the house a neighbor came riding up his horse only had a loop on its nose and he was bareheaded, and riding on a high loop, he told mother she better get oput of here quick saying the indians are coming they are just over the hill. Mother said, How can I get out of here with with these two babies? he said I dont know but you better hurry they have have just killed a man in Bare Spring Flat about 15 miles from here, Mother said if they were chasing him on a horse, how could she get out two babies and another coming expect to stay alive for long? Mother went into the shack and under the bed, the little boys began to cry for water and she herself could spit cotton she was so thirsty, and in the afternoon late here came a dust stormand it took the roof off the shack and she was looking for indians all that time but none came, and as it neared sundown she could see indians sillouetted on the crest of the hillsor raises above the shack. It turned out to be roses and their flowers looked so much like feathers. Father had been late getting home that night and found his family in a state of confusion. as the storm blowed off timbers which hit little Winnie and hurt him badly, and they were all so thirsty and afraid to go for water. They were very glad when father came home to share their troubles. It was learned that Brother Frank Thirston had been killed out in the Bare Springs Flat about 15 miles away.<br>Mother had three boys then a girl, and after they began to grow bigger father took the t wo older ones to help him and the two younger ones were left at home to help mother. these two were Ed and Ida, they helped in the house and did chores each helping the other with outside work and house work. Ed Moody said one morning he got up real early saw a wild cat taking their only chicken from the coop old tom the dog right after it. Well he said; that night I waited till late to get the firewood in for night and as I carried it around the corner of the coop, Sam was there playing a trick on me as I rounded the corner he jumped out on all fours and yelled BOO at me. Well I thought that it was the wild cat so I dropped wood right on him and ran for the house, and under the bed I went, screaming bloody murder, mother was disgusted trying to find out what the trouble was, Sam came in bawling , saying Ed had dumped a whole armload wood on top of him and he dident like it. Soon mother saw the funny side of it and advised him not to scare his brother like that , and not to act like a wild cat again.<br>Mother had a little girl named Eunice and a boy named Johnnie, these two were both take n from us. When our little Johnnie died, father was somewhere between home and Globe, on the freight road, mother sent him word by the stage line, he got the word at San Carlos in the evening, that he road a mile about 45-50 miles home he dident dare to stay on the road as it was very dangerous while the indians were roving the country, he took to the brush lands and over trackless wastes, but it was the safest way home getting here in time to take over the responsibilities and burial of our precious baby.<br>Dad was on the freight road a long time, and one time the renegade indians had left th e reservation and were doing all the damage they could. Mother was at home alone with us small children and was always nervous and upset always afraid the indians might come and kill us all. One night she got up out of bed after midnight, took us children barefooted and started for grandmothers home more than a mile away, she too was afraid to travel the road but took to the brushes others did and when she got to where the music hall now stands on the College grounds in Thatcher, she encountered a bed of rattle snakes, it seemed there was a thousand of them but suppose there was only about a dozen anyway, even one of them would have been terrible that time of night or morning and so dark, Mother like a real mother said a prayer, asking for help from on High, and got it, she took the baby in her arms told the other children to walk behind her and walked through that infested spot in safety, reaching her mother's home which was just south of the Thatcher church house, Of course mother aroused the family Grandmother was scared when she saw mother looking so white and nervous, she told her her story and they were soon safe and resting. One of the great lessons mother taught us was to pray whenever we needed help (and here is another great lesson, besides praying when we need help is to pray always and thank the Lord every day for all our blessings then when we need help we have a little bank account to draw from, If we only pray when we want something we are very poor children indeed)<br>We mothers children marvel at the accomplishments of our little mother.If anybody was i n need mother was there if she knew about it, Mallard Preston when his mother died said my mother went there and did sewing for him and his brothers and sisters, how she maid pants shirts and dresses, helped them a lot. and she also helped the Carlson children when their mother died. Andy was just a little fellow, once he started down the road, mother ask him where he was going, O he said I am going down the road to see what I can see, then see if I cansee it, always seeing for the humorous side, It always helps to bear your burdens mother would say.<br>In the year father and Sam started freifhting from Naco and Canneneia in Mexico. Winni e got work in Clifton, that left me to run the farm, dad had put in 20 acres of Lucern and some grain, it only got about a foot high when the drowth hit it and it dried uop. but lots of food there. One day as the lod wood burning train came rumbling through some sparks from the engine settled in the dry pasture and set it on fire and burned the whole field. Mother and I were up town we saw the big smoke, later saw it was our field on fire we were just heartsick, but the Rail Road never gave us a penny for our loss.<br>Mother had to be a farmer and handyman in every way, and those wash days---We had to dra w water from a 40 foot well heat it over a wood fire, then wash scrub and boil the clothes, such a job, scrub on a washboard with homemade soap, We had an old washer that turned a wheel back and forth over and over againand How I grumbled and fussed because I had to do the work. I was so honery and gripped so much. I know mother would rather have done it herself but it was us kids who needed the work and the responsibility. O if mother could have lived to enjoy some of the modern help we have today, and we should be more appreciative of our parents and what they have done for us.<br>On the morning of July 28 1903, mother was very sick I was sent to get the Elders, whe n I got back I was met at the bedroom door I was met by a Relief Society Sister and she said Ed you will have to hurry your mother has been waiting for you, she cant hold out much longer, so I rushed in kneeled by her bed but was so full I could say nothing, she put her hand on my broe and said Ed you have always been a good boy to me then her hand dropped and she was gone, she had already said goodby to the other children, and was only waiting for me to come so she could go for she was called home, and in those few seconds there flashed thru my mind a thousand ways in which I had been unkind, I went out on the porch and there was my five year old sister her three year old brother in her arms and both sobbing their little hearts out. So I took them both in my arms and resolved to be a good brother and help dad all I could as he had a great responsibility now more than ever. I have seen and heard of motherless children, but you can never realize what it is to be without a mothertil you lose your own. And the dear little helpless babe, after the funeral was over and we were back home, everything seemed so strange, couldent help but feel that mother would come walking thru the door, and I am sure she was worrying about us and the dear little babe who needed her care so badly. Surely she lingered close by and with us guiding us from pitfallsas best we would listen to her influence. The little babe dident have the best of care, we dident know anything about baby formulas, sanatation and sterelized bottles and baby care so Ida did the best she could at carring for it but it dident do very well, and finely Aunt Keturah came from Mexico and took over the care of this precious little bundle of humanity. and she did a good part by it. I still think it was mother's spirit urging our Aunt to come care for this our dear baby sister. And so time went on and we had to adjust to a new kind of life.<br>Of course in mother's life she couldent have accomplished so much without the help of po or old dad. with all the sorrows and tragedys mother went thru,we could hear her sing and see her sweet smile, how their children will never know. Take me for instance: When I was three years old I got a butcher knife from the table, mother called me but instead of stopping I ran faster and fell on the back doorstep, the knife ran into my left temple cutting a great gash and it bleed profusily, mother dident know how to stop it, so she tried ashes then flour, but with the help of sister Barney and several hours work it was finely stopped. I lost a lot of blood.<br>When I was about five years old my brothers Winnie and Sam were going over to our neighb ors the prices to return some borrowed matches, Cousin Arthur went with them and I bawled to go so I went and after returning the matches we all went up to see grandmother, as we started home a man by the name of Swanger came along offering us a ride, they all climbed but me and and the man said Are you all in? someone said yes so he started out, I was climbing on the wheel and the wagon ran over me, I was carried home with a broken hip. Dr. Rosebeck set it, and as there was no plaster to be had for a cast, I was wrapped in a sheet and someone had to be by me for thirty daysand nites to keep me quiet while my hip healed.<br>Once we had smallpox and scarlet fever, and had to be quarrenteened, still my parents fo und time to help their neighbors five miles away. Once mother went to Central to help with the sick, and dad was to come take her home, she got tired waiting and walked home thru a thicket of battomoney where the hobos were very bad, father was just starting after her when she came walking in.<br>Cousin Ed said Mother taught me this little poem; as he was always asking when his birt hday was, an how old he would be. I will be four years old the 16 of September, and mother will make me a cake if I can remember, and told me if I would tell you today, with little cousin Arthur I might go and play,I love my grandma and like to get her wood, she always tells me thank youmom, and gives me something good.<br>Reception honoring Winfred Moody and his bride Malinda Lewis. <br>Comment; this should have been given on the first page but was missed. After our parents retu rned from St. George When they were married their folks at home gage them a lovely reception, in fact it was the very first one ever given in the Gila Valley, a great crowd of relatives and friends gathered to wish them well and to enjoy the evening of fun, They danced, had singing and speech making, songs like, The little brown church in the Vale, The Old Oken Bucket, Juanita, and many of the old ballads were sung, and stump speeches were the order of the day. Ida says At this party her parents received many lovely and usefull gifts. Grandfather Moody Grandfather Moody gave them a credit card for $100 dollars on the store, and I remember two large pictures whitch hung on the walls one especially was a picture of the Niagra Falls, dont remember who gave it to them.<br>Along with all their trials they had to endure, mother tells of going to plays, Theaters , an outstanding one was Ten Nights in a Bar Room, and many others famous at that time, they had many dances, quiltings, candy pullings, and hay rack ridesnearly all their fun was combined with work of some kind.<br>Mother was a student of a nursing class held in Thatcher, it was sponsored by the Mormo n church, the St. Joseph Stake, directing the work here. Our Mother joined this class, and continued the studies till she completed the courseand received her diploma. She was a big help among her friends and neighbors, always ready to help the sickand it seemed there was always plenty of sickness at that time. Rulen was the baby then and Ida was the baby tender, she would take the baby to mother about twice a day, while at school to be nursed, then bring him back home till mother returned.<br>Here are some comments from the little sister June, I remember; My sister Ida took car e of us children when mother was away helping the sick. When Winnie was down with typhoid fever, so awfully sick mother sent me to stay with Aunt Susie Claridge with my grandmother Moody, I watched her put my clothes away in a drawer. I got so homesick that once when every one was away I took out my clothes and walked home. I must have been about five years old and walked a mile to my home. Mother dident schold me she just put her arms around me and loved me, I was a home girl I tell you Home sickness is the worst sickness there is. I remember when Winnie was sick and they gave him Eagle Brand milk it is so sweet and ood, once I said Mother I wish I was sick so I could have some of that milk. Mother said Dear you don't to get sick to get some of that milk so she gave me some. Mother had a beautiful Alapaca dress long sleeves, skirt and high neck, she wore it to church, she was a good seamstress, very tidy and proud, she held her head high and she had beautiful hands, she was very kind and gentle. Our cousin Arthut Lewis stayed with us a lot even till my mother died later he went to Mexico and lived with Aunt Keturah Baker. When mother was so sick they took Rulenand me to Aunt Lulas, and we werent home when mother passed. I can never forget the terrible loss I felt, I used to cry myself to sleep and have bad dreams, when it would thunder and rain I would think about mother up there in that big hole and I was afraid she would get cold. I would go to other homes and see the girls with mothers and feel so bad because I dident have one. Altho father was so good to us and he took mother's place and did the best he could not even he could take mother's place. Later I realized how he missed her also. We stayed with grandma for some time after mother left usthen we settled down at home I was 11 years and Glenna was 13, she did the washing and ironing while I did the cooking, we had to bake bread and it was a hard job for girls so young. We did a lot of singing, at home father would card on the old organ and we sing the different parts, he used to play, O My Father, After mother passed away I couldent stand to hear that song, I tore the page out of the hymn book, they practiced it one Sunday in Sunday School, I got to crying and had to leave, Elizabeth Pace saw me leave came and talked to me till I got control of myself. Glenna did our sewing she made us both just alike people sometimes thot we were twins.<br>CONCLUSION <br>Winfred Moody was president of the High Priests Quorum, of the St. Joseph Stake, and Bro ther Cheny was one of his councilers, Well Brother Cheny died and of (course) father had to go to the funeral, he dident tell mother because he dident want to worry her, but we children knew about it, About 2 P.M.mother went into a coma, father was sent for and when he returned she felt better so he told her where he had been. Yes she told him I knew where you were, I was there also, and I saw several people there who have been gone over there a long time, then she told him the names of the speakers there and the songs they sang, for she heard and saw the whole funeral service. To me this was a great testimony that there is a great hereafter, and that our loved ones are often allowed to visit us here.<br>Quote from Ida's story. The next day I was alone in the house , and Mother called me t o her bedside and said, Ida I must go and leave all of you soon,and you will have to take over the responsibility of being a mother to your brothers and sisters, especially to the little baby. I became frightened and ran out into the orchard and prayed for someone to come to help us, soon Aunt Lizzie was at the door, she said, How is your mother? I have the Relief Society sisters at my house quilting and had dinner ready to serve, A voice said to me Go to Malinda I said to myself that I would go as soon I got the dinner over with, Again the voice said Go to Malinda I ask one of the ladies to serve dinner and here I am, I never waited to hear more, I ran to the orchard again and thanked my Heavenly Father for answering my second prayer. and this is another wonderful Testimony to me that the Lord hears and answers PRAYERS.<br>Brother Ed quotes; Anyway we all grew up, married, made homes of our own and raised ou r families as best we knew how, Perhaps we have regrets for things we left undone thru the years, and perhaps we did things we shouldent have done. but such is life and thru the teachings of our dear parents, we have tried hard to bring up our children so that our parents behind the veil will be proud of their grandchildren, who have been taught to be noble and honorable.<br>Now we are getting older than our mother was when she passed on. I was only fourteen yea rs old when mother died just knew her that long; I wish I could put love and honor into my children as mother did with hers, it is hard to realize that mother accomplished so much in such a short life. Today her little babe she left is sisty two years old, a lovely woman, It wont be long now till we will all be with mother and father again. in a family group Over There I am seventy eight now and I hope I am ready to go home when my call comes."

Grant Moody 1424 South College Avenue Tempe, Arizona 85281 Copyright 1985<br>pages 543-545 <br>FRANCIS WINFRED MOODY <br>Son of John Monroe Moody & Elizabeth Pool Moody <br>Francis Winfred, son of John Monroe and Elizabeth Pool Moody was born August 26, 1858 i n Salt Lake City, Utah. While a very small child he suffered from seizures that threatened his life . Through the administration of his father and several elders, he matured to manhood with no further incident.<br>In the fall of 1861 when the family moved to Dixie, Winfred was three years old. He stayed with his mother in Pine Valley until 1863 when his family moved to St. George. <br>At age 14 in 1872 he accompanied a friend to Salt Lake City. The boys passed through the empty town of Panguitch, its inhabitants having removed to a fort because of an Indian raid by one of the bands of Indians who refused to stay on a reservation, but roamed Utah and Idaho trying to get enough food to stay alive.<br>Winfred helped build the temple. He hauled cobble rock for the foundation, then dressed rock from the quarry on the west side of St. George. He was present at its dedication by Brigham Young. <br>He saw Brigham Young and George A. Smith when they would come to Dixie. The Sunday school children used to go and welcome them, cheering from both sides of the road. President Young would bow and smile at them as he passed, then the band and the children and the other settlers would fall in behind the carriage.<br>In the spring of 1879, Winfred went to Provo to attend the Brigham Young Academy. He said goodby to his family and girl friend, Miss Eunice Renbow Carter. He remained in school two terms. Then his father wrote asking him to come back. His brother John was in Europe on a mission, and John Monroe was having a hard time supporting the family without Winfred's help. Winfred had intended to finish school, but never got another opportunity.<br>When the Moodys moved to Arizona, Winfred followed some days later. He took time to call on Miss Carter, to whom he had previously given a ring. He told her he'd come back in two years, then hurried to catch up with the others. <br>But Winfred didn't go back for Miss Carter; he fell in love with Malinda Gimlin Lewis, 16, whom he met at the first Founder's Day Celebration of Smithville, picking her out as the most beautiful among a group of<br>girls coming down the street. On September 21, 1882, they started for St. George, Utah to be married;  his journal describes the trip. <br>There were 34 persons in the party which included his father John Monroe, Malinda's sister Laura, who was to become the plural wife of Peter McBride, and Malinda's mother, Sarah Jane Huntsman Lew is, who, as Winfred ruefully reported, carefully supervised the association of Malinda and Winfred but paid little heed to her older daughter and already married Peter. Malinda experienced poor health for the entire trip, suffering from chills and fever, thought to be malaria. <br>The group went by way of Snowflake to attend their stake conference. From here John Monroe and some others returned home, while those in the wedding group traveled northward to Lee's Ferry on the Colorado river. The group separated, some went directly to St. George via Kanab, but Winfred's party went by way of Panguitch (the former home of the Lewis family) and Cedar City. Malinda's illness put a cloud over the festivities in St. George. However, finally the long desired day came, it being the 7th of November 1882.<br>Winfred and Malinda were married by temple President John D. T McAllister. He learned that his brother John, who had returned to St George from his mission, was keeping company with his former fiance Miss Eunice Carter. <br>Winfred regreted being unable to see his aged Aunt Dorinda Slade in Pine Valley, but they decided to return November 9, 1882, coming by way of Pipe Springs and Kanab. In Sunset, Arizona they were invited to stay for conference and help with the music. We also ate at the long table as they all lived in the Order under the direction of Lot Smith. They passed through the Apache Indian Reservation and arrived in Smithville (Pima) on December 8, 1882. When they returned home, there was a wedding reception at his father's flat-roofed adobe house, the first party of its kind in the valley of the Gila River. <br>Winfred was 24 when he built a small house for his new wife. There she bore her first two sons; three more boys and six girls were to follow. Winfred supported his family principally by farming . The railroad had not yet been built, so in 1881 Winfred began periodically hauling freight from Wilcox and Bowie and San Carlos and Globe, Arizona. This provided some needed cash. Although this route cut through the Indian Reservation Winfred never carried a gun thinking that an Indian would kill him as quickly for his gun as for any other reason. <br>The restive Apaches would occasionally break out of the reservation plundering and killing. At one time, his wife Malinda was alone with her four small children when she heard that the notorious Apache Kid had broken out again. Frightened, she walked at night through the brush two miles, avoiding the public road, to her mother's house.<br>Suddenly the five of them were surrounded by the sounds of the rattling of several rattlesnakes. Not being able to turn back. Malinda offered a prayer, picked up the smallest child, Ida, lined up her three barefoot boys behind her, and walked safely through.<br>Winfred and Malinda became the parents of 11 children, nine of whom lived to adulthood . Except for a few years in Central, they lived in Thatcher in a brick house with two large rooms and a porch on the front. When Malinda's mother had to come live with them. Winfred moved the porch to the back and made a kitchen out of it so that they would have more room. One day Grandma Lewis backed up to the fireplace and her clothes blazed up. Winfred put out the flames with his bare hands, but she died of the burns. <br>The first Thatcher L.D.S. Church services were held under a bowery at Bishop John Monro e Moody's home June 3 1883. At one time Winfred served concurrently as Sunday School superintendent, ward clerk, counselor to bishop Samuel Claridge and as a member of the ward choir. In 1892 he began six years as stake clerk under Christopher Layton. missing only one meeting during this assignment. While freigh ting he would often travel late into the night in order to not miss a meeting. He often found it necessar y to use his personal journal for ward and stake records. (The L.D.S. Church Archives. Salt Lake City. Utah now holds this large diary which contains also the diary ofJohn Monroe and Elizabeth Pool Moody.) <br>Winfred was completely dedicated to his Savior and His earthly kingdom. Someone said tha the reason he was so poor was the time spent discharging his duties and in being strictly honest in payin g his tithing and taxes. But he felt secure in the Lord's love and watchful care. <br>Winfred worked on public projects such as constructing the Central and Union irrigation canals with their brush and rock diversion dams in the river. On October 18, 1886 he began assisting in makin g adobes for and whitewashing a schoolhouse. His cash contribution of nearly $100 was next to the highest made toward the $700 project. <br>His journal states that once he returned home from work to find Malinda suffering from chills and a raging fever. Sister Lee annointed her and Sister East administered to her  as was the custom in that day.<br>In 1892 he obtained a patent to his homestead in Thatcher. In 1894 he sold a sixty foot right-of-way through his land to the railroad for $100. Instead of this going to discharge debts. it was used to assist his<br>cousin William A.Moody to go on a mission to Samoa. <br>Malinda and Winfred were constantly called upon as practical nurses in the community. On March 28 1903, when she was 37 and expecting her eleventh child. Winfred wrote that Malinda, wore her self out<br>waiting on the sick, a work she loved. suffering from pneumonia as well as fatigue. She gave birth to a baby girl July 9. 1903. A nurse at $2 a day, daily visits by a doctor. and Winfred's own care helped her to recover from the childbirth but not from her lung infection. She died on July 28. 1903. If ever a woman was prepared to die she was. She did not fear death but would have liked to have lived to see her family raised.<br>Winfred was again in financial difficulty. He had built a fine $3600 brick home on his Central farm which together with costs of sickness required him to mortgage both of his farms. Furthermore, insects and drought had produced crop failures, but his faith and commitment to the Lord's work remained undaunted. <br>Sometime prior to 1907, Bishop William A. Moody had prevailed upon Winfred to provide nursing care for Brigham Stewart and family who were near death. The promised help was not forthcoming, requiring<br>Winfred to be on constant duty for 51 days until the family could care for themselves. This placed a severe strain on Winfred who himself had not healed from a recent circumcision, consequences being exema on his hands and cancer in his surgical wound. <br>As drowning men are want to grasp at any straw, on February 5, 1913, I left for Los An geles, California to be cured of a cancer I had for seven years.The medical quack took from him $800 plus 56 4 hospital cost. Francis returned home in April. Later, he returned again to Los Angeles and on December 2. 1913, the doctor again started to kill my cancer. After six weeks Francis returned home and here his journal ends.<br>Excruciating pain continued: after being bedridden for awhile, Winfred departed this world August 18, 1919.<br>His life had been one of devotion and selfless service. He had followed the creed, If business interferes with your church duty, then get rid of your business, and, If someone has to get cheated in a business deal, I'd rather be the one cheated than the one doing the cheating."

There was snow on the ground, and it took us three days as the democrat did not go very well over snow.<br>We got stoves, oats for the horses, and our groceries from town.  We then had to cut logs to make a cabin.  We put up in a sod shack that we dound, and we nearly froze.  The meat did not thaw out much, even by the stove.<br>We put our horses in the tent, and we got a little hay from John Ash, a rancher.  Gordon Walker was working for him at that time.  We dound when our hay was gone that we had to go back to Innisfail, where I got a job with a man named Fred Wade, for the rest of the winter.

He sailed, with his family, to America in 1730, to the colony of Pennsylvania. he settled with other Scotch-Irish in what was then pert of Lancaster County, today it is Cumberland Township of Adams County, Pennsylvania. They were active members of the historic Presbyterian Church at Marsh Creek settlement. <br>Samuel's eldest son John Paxton, died there in Pennsylvania, but his wife Elizabeth (Alexander) Paxton went south to the Valley of Virginia about 1747 with her five sons where they settled near Lexington in present Rockbridge County.

O<br>n November 12, 1762, he was chosen a vestryman for Blisland Parish and served actively until he moved to Spotsylvania Cunty. He was also a county justice of the peace and colonel of militia in New Kent County. He must have been named commander of the county militia in 1764 or 1765 for his title, as recorded in the vestry book of the parish, changed from Mr. to Col. In 1766, William was trustee along with Alexander Bolling and William Allen, for the sale of Broadway, in Prince George County, Virginia. This was the property of Dr. William Stark, who married William's sister, Mary Bassett Daingerfield. There are no extant records to confirm his military service. He moved to Spotsylvania County in about 1770, when his wife, Sarah Taliaferro, inherited a 1300-acre plantation, possibly from her grandmother, Mary Catlett Taliaferro. The Blisland Parish vestry chose a replacement for him on October 23, 1770, . . .in the stead of Col. William Daingerfield, who is removed out of the parish.<br>By 1774, he and his family were living at Belvidera, on the Rappahannock River, seven mile s below Fredericksburg. Belvidera was built on a high bluff overlooking the Rappahannock. It was a rectangular, brick, two-story house of the simple design characteristic of rural dwellings in tidewater Virginia. The plantation was a working farm that was not comparable to the great mansions of the largest planters. The diary of John Harrower, who was employed by Col. Daingerfield as a tutor for his children from the summer of 1774 until Harrower's death in April, 1777, contains many details of Col. Daingerfield's way of life. He had a large plantation, many slaves, owned a chariot, and shipped 3600 bushels of wheat annually to England. But he was apparently plagued by financial problems. In February, 1782, he was forced to borrow 1000 pounds and secure the debt with his wife's 1300 acres on Snow Creek. Althugh he was able to repay the debt within a month, on August 2, 1782, he sold his New Kent County lands. Greatly distressed and agitated, he made his will on January 4, 1783. According to E. M. Riley, editor of The Journal of John Harrower (1963, Holt, Rinehart and Winston), Early the next day, a Sunday, he and Colonel Bland rode to General Spotswood's home for breakfast. Here they parted and Daingerfield set out alone 'down the Country.' Two weeks later a Fredericksburg lawyer, James Mercer, recorded the sudden end of the story with these words: '. . .can you believe it? Colo. Daingerfield cut his Throat at New Castle last week & is now no more! I really shall be afraid of a. . .Knife for a month to come'.<br>The appraisal of Col. Daingerfield's property listed 68 slaves valued at 3085 pounds; livesto ck worth about 468 pounds; and personal property appraised at about 3854 pounds. Mr. Riley comments, This was a not inconsiderable estate. The loss of the tobacco for which he sold his New Kent land was not sufficient to bankrupt him. Apparently he had become mentally unbalanced by worry from unknown causes."
"NI14546","He inherited the house and much of the land at Belvidera. According to E. M. Riley, He apparently led a rather dissolute life. When he died in 1842, Belvidera was sold by his creditors."
"NI14548","He was educated in medicine at the Medical College, Edinburgh, Scotland. He settled in Alexa<br>ndria, Virginia about 1800, but moved to Prince George's County, Maryland, about 1806. He served as a colonel of militia in the War of 1812, and died at Wood Cot, his estate in Prince George's County, Maryland."
"NI14561","William Henry Daingerfield moved to San Antonio, Texas, in October, 1837. He was elected may<br>or of San Antonio in 1838. He became chief justice of Bexar County the same year and in 1839 was appointed commissary of purchases of the Army of the Republic of Texas. He was senator from Bexar County in the Fifth and Sixth Congresses of Texas, 1840-1842, but resigned on February 5, 1842, to become Secretary of the Treasury. In February, 1844, he became Texas charge d'affaires to the Netherlands, where he remained until annexation. In 1860 he returned to Washington, D. C., and opened a law office nearby. He died in September, 1878, at his residence, Wood Cot, in Prince Georges County, Maryland.<br>Professional card, apparently published in the Marlborough Gazette: Wm. Henry Daingerfield , Att'y, may be found at his residence Wood Cot, Prince George's Co., or at the office of Messrs. Browning and Ewing, 15 N. A St., Capitol Hill, Washington. When in Marlborough, at the office of Samuel Hance. 1869."
